Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. apple\n2. bread\n3. table\n4. mouse\n5. horse\n\nNow, since this is our first guess, we don't have any prior guesses to intersect the letters with. Therefore, let's choose a word from the list above based on our intuition. \n\nFor our first guess, let's go with \"mouse\".\n\nSo, my guess is \"mouse\".",
      "Step 1: Analyze prior information\n- The prior guess of \"mouse\" resulted in 2 letters being in the secret word.\n- We need to find a word that is different from any previous guesses.\n\nStep 2: Determine the intersection of letters\n- Since we don't have any prior guesses to intersect with, we cannot utilize this strategy yet.\n\nStep 3: Explore alternative strategies\n- Since we know that the word \"mouse\" had 2 letters in the secret word, we can try to identify those letters and their positions in the word.\n- By determining the positions of those 2 letters, we can focus on finding words that share those positions.\n- Let's try to narrow down the possibilities further.\n\nStep 4: Identify the possible letters based on positions\n- There are several five letter words with two letters being in the secret word, so we need to consider what positions those letters might be in.\n- For example, if the two letters are in positions 1 and 2, we can look for words that have repeated letters in those positions (e.g., \"roomy\").\n- If the two letters are in positions 1 and 3, we can search for words with a common letter for the first and third positions (e.g., \"moody\").\n- If the two letters are in positions 2 and 4, we can search for words with a common letter for the second and fourth positions (e.g., \"moons\").\n- If the two letters are in positions 4 and 5, we can search for words with repeated letters in those positions (e.g., \"knees\").\n- If the two letters are in positions 1 and 5, we can look for words with a common letter for the first and fifth positions (e.g., \"moved\").\n\nStep 5: Determine the next guess\n- Based on the possibilities explored in step 4, we can choose a word that meets the conditions mentioned.\n- Let's choose the word \"moons\" as our next guess.\n\nFINAL GUESS: moons",
      "Step 1: Analyze the intersection of the letters in the prior guesses.\n\nThe intersecting letters in the two prior guesses are 'o' and 's'. So, we know that these two letters are in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Combine the intersecting letters to form a new word.\n\nFrom the intersecting letters 'o' and 's', we can form the word 'so'.\n\nStep 3: Submit the new word as the guess to the other player.\n\nI will submit the guess 'so' to the other player.",

However, since player only shares one letter in common with the secret word, we can conclude that the common letter 'o' is not at the same position in the secret word.\n\nTo further narrow down our options, let's list the remaining possible letters that could be in the secret word based on the previous responses:\n\nPossible letters: m, u, s, e, p, l, a, y, r\n\nNow, to choose our next guess, we will aim to maximize our chances of narrowing down the possibilities. Let's pick a word that contains a letter from the possible letters list but does not repeat any letters that we have already guessed. Since we have not used the letter 's' yet, let's choose a word that includes it:\n\nPotential words: mouse, moons, player, smart, leaps, story\n\nAmong the potential words, 'smart' seems like a good choice as it contains the letter 's' and does not repeat any letters from our previous guesses.

Here are a few possibilities:\n1. Mists\n2. Lamps\n3. Rooms\n4. Smack\n\nStep 4: Choose the next guess\nBased on the options, the word that stands out is \"Mists\". It contains the common letters \"m\" and \"s\". Therefore, the next guess to submit to the other player is \"Mists\".",

It includes the letters \"m\", \"o\", \"s\", and \"t\" which have appeared in prior valid guesses, and it also has a different letter \"i\" which might be part of the secret word.\n\nTherefore, the word to submit is: moist.",

Smite \n3. Smock \n4. Smote \n5. Stamp \n\nOut of these options, I think \"smite\" is the best choice as it uses both 'm' and 's'. \n\nSo, the word I will submit to the other player is \"smite\".",
      "Step 1: Analyzing the previous guesses\nFrom the given information, we can summarize the results of the previous guesses as follows:\n- \"mouse\" has 2 letters in common with the secret word\n- \"moons\" has 1 letter in common with the secret word\n- \"player\" has 1 letter in common with the secret word\n- \"smart\" has 2 letters in common with the secret word\n- \"Mists\" has 1 letter in common with the secret word\n- \"player\" (repeated guess) has 1 letter in common with the secret word\n- \"moist\" has 2 letters in common with the secret word\n- \"smite\" has 1 letter in common with the secret word\n\nStep 2: Finding the common letters\nWe can now find the common letters among these guesses. We will ignore any repeated letters within a single guess:\n\nCommon letters: m, o, s, t, e\n\nStep 3: Constructing a new word\nUsing these common letters as a base, we can create a new word by rearranging them. One possible word could be \"moste\".\n\nTherefore, the word you should submit to the other player is \"moste\".",

It seems that these letters are likely to be part of the secret word.\n\nTo come up with a new word, we can combine the common letters from CHAIR and CHIPS with any other letter. This way, we ensure that our new guess is different from any previous guess.

Therefore, we can choose any word from the list as our first guess. Let's go with \"Paint.\"\n\nNow, after receiving feedback from the other player, we can adjust our strategy. If the other player tells us that there are zero letters from our guess that are also in the secret word, we need to choose a new word that does not have any letters from \"Paint.\" Similarly, if the other player tells us that there is only one letter from our guess in the secret word, we should avoid using that letter in our next guess.\n\nLet's assume that the other player tells us that there are two letters from \"Paint\" in the secret word.

Let's analyze the overlapping letters:\n\n- \"letters\" and \"before\" share the letter \"e\". They also have the letter \"r\" in common with the word \"error\".\n- \"provided\" and \"before\" share the letter \"e\".\n\nStep 3: Generating Potential Words\nNow, let's generate potential words that include the common letters we found:\n\n- Using the common letter \"e\" from \"letters\" and \"before,\" we can try words like \"emote,\" \"elite,\" or \"feline.\"\n- Using the common letters \"e\" and \"r\" from \"letters,\" \"before,\" and \"error,\" we can try words like \"ember\" or \"cheer.\"\n\nStep 4: Choosing the Guess\nSince we have two potential words so far (\"emote\" and \"ember\"), we need more information to narrow down our guess. Since the other player has not provided any feedback about specific letters, we cannot make a definitive decision. However, we can choose one of the potential words as our next guess.\n\nIn this case, let's go with \"emote\" as our guess.\n\nStep 5: Submitting the Guess\nYou submitted the word \"emote\" as your guess."

This means that at least 4 letters in the secret word are also present in the word \"SHIFT\".\n\nStep 2: Identify the common letters\nTo make an educated guess, we need to determine the common letters between \"SHIFT\" and the secret word.

From the information given, we can see that \"G\" appears in the secret word at least once. Since Grace shares three letters with the secret word, it is likely that \"G\" is repeated in the secret word.\n\nBased on these observations, we can make an initial guess:\n\nGuess: G__ __ __\n\nSince the letters \"e\" and \"s\" are also common to some of the previous guesses, we can include them in this new guess to increase the chances of having more common letters with the secret word:\n\nGuess: G__ __ __s\n\nNow it's time to submit this guess and see how many letters it shares with the secret word.",

We know that the secret word has 4 letters that are also in the word \"word\". \n\nPossible letters: W, O, R, D\n\nNext, let's try to combine these letters in different ways to form words that we can guess. \n\nPossible combinations:\n- WORDS\n- SWORD\n- ROW\n- DROW\n- ROD\n- DOW\n\nNow, we need to check which of these words we haven't guessed before. \n\nWords we have already guessed: word\n\nFrom the list of possible combinations, the word \"WORDS\" is a good guess because it combines all the possible letters. \n\nYou should submit \"WORDS\" as your guess to the other player.",

We need to find a word that has an intersection of the letters in these previous guesses.\n\nStep 2: Finding the common letters\n\nLet's find the common letters among the previous guesses. \n- The word \"word\" has the letters \"w\", \"o\", \"r\", and \"d\".\n- The word \"player\" has the letters \"p\", \"l\", \"a\", and \"r\".\n- The word \"dragon\" has the letters \"d\", \"r\", \"a\", and \"o\".\n- The word \"order\" has the letters \"o\", \"r\", and \"d\".\n\nFrom these letters, we can see that the intersection is the letters \"r\" and \"o\" which appear in all of the previous guesses.\n\nStep 3: Guessing the word\n\nTo maximize our chances of finding the secret word, let's form a five-letter word using the common letters \"r\" and \"o\" that have appeared in all the previous guesses. \n\nA possible word could be \"floor\".\n\nAfter considering the previous guesses, the word \"floor\" will be submitted to the other player as the next guess.",
      "Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Start by analyzing the letters that are common between all of your prior guesses - \"word,\" \"player,\" \"dragon,\" and \"order.\" The only common letters in all of these words are 'o' and 'r'. \n\n2. Since the secret word has 4 letters in common with \"word,\" 2 letters in common with \"player,\" 3 letters in common with \"dragon,\" and 3 letters in common with \"order,\" it's likely that the secret word contains all of the letters 'o', 'r', and at least one of the other two letters common between the guesses.\n\n3. Next, let's consider the word \"guess,\" which had 0 letters in common with the secret word. This suggests that our previous approach of using common letters might not be accurate in this case.\n\n4. Given this new information, let's try a different strategy. We can focus on the letters that are unique to each word and see if any patterns emerge. \n\n5. The letters unique to each word are:\n- \"word\": 'w'\n- \"player\": 'a', 'y'\n- \"dragon\": 'a', 'g'\n- \"order\": 'd'\n\n6. By analyzing these unique letters, we can observe that 'a' is present in both \"player\" and \"dragon,\" so it is highly likely that 'a' is also in the secret word. \n\n7. Taking all this into consideration, we can make an educated guess that the secret word might contain the letters 'o', 'r', 'a', plus two more letters.\n\nBased on this analysis, a possible word to submit to the other player could be \"flora\" (containing 'o', 'r', 'a').

This will give us the common letters that are appearing in the secret word.\n\nFrom the given information, we can see that the letters \"o\", \"r\", and \"d\" are common in both \"word\" and \"order\". Therefore, these three letters are most likely to be present in the secret word.\n\nConsidering these intersections, a new word we can suggest is \"world\" as it has the combination of \"word\" and \"order\" with the common letters.\n\nTherefore, the word to submit to the other player as a guess will be \"world.\""

Trace\n\nStep 2: Make an Initial Guess\nSince we have no prior guesses, we will start with a random word from our list. Let's go with \"Brave\" as our initial guess.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the Feedback\nBased on the feedback received from the other player, we will update our list of possible words. For example, if the other player says that two letters from our guess are part of the secret word, we will only consider five-letter words from our initial list that have two common letters with \"Brave.\"\n\nUpdated list based on the feedback (assuming two letters are common):\n1. Amber\n2. Dance\n3. Nymph\n\nStep 4: Analyze the Remaining Options\nNow, we can analyze the remaining options in our updated list. Considering the feedback, we need to find a word that has two common letters with \"Brave.\" Additionally, we should try to pick a word that maximizes the chances of finding the secret word in the fewest possible guesses.\n\nTaking a closer look at our updated list, both \"Amber\" and \"Nymph\" have two common letters with \"Brave.\" However, \"Amber\" has different common letters than \"Dance\" and \"Nymph,\" providing a more diverse set of options for future guesses.\n\nStep 5: Make the Next Guess\nHaving analyzed the remaining options, we should submit \"Amber\" as our next guess.\n\nFinal Guess: Amber",

Some examples could be:\n1. Pasta\n2. Brake\n3. Alarm\n4. Apart\n5. Acorn\n\nSince we need to choose a word that is different from any previous guesses, we can eliminate \"Amber,\" \"Amaze,\" and \"Apple\" from the list.

Repeat this process with each generated word until you have a comprehensive list of all possible five letter words.\n\nStep 2: Select a word from the list as the initial guess\n\nSince we have no prior guesses, we can randomly select any word from the list as our initial guess.

Let's assume they tell us that two letters in our guess are in the secret word.\n\nStep 4: Filter the word list based on the feedback\n\nBased on the feedback, we can eliminate words from our list that do not have the same number of letters in common with our guess as the feedback indicated. In this case, we will remove all words from the list that do not have exactly two letters in common with \"table\".\n\nStep 5: Select the next guess from the remaining word list\n\nFrom the filtered word list, we now need to select the next guess.

Let's start by listing all the letters that are present in the words \"results\", \"submit\", \"STUBS\", \"guess\", and \"SUNUP\".\n   - From \"results\": R\n   - From \"submit\": S, U, B, M, I, T\n   - From \"STUBS\": S, T, U, B\n   - From \"guess\": G, U, E, S\n   - From \"SUNUP\": S, U, N, P\n\n2. Now, let's find the intersection of these letters (letters that are present in all the words) to get the common letters.\n   - Common letters: S, U (as they appear in all the words)\n\n3. Since we know that the secret word contains at least one letter from the guess \"SUNUP\", and \"SUNUP\" has one common letter with all the prior guesses, let's guess a word that includes the common letters \"S\" and \"U\".\n\nOne possible word is \"USUAL\".\n\nMy guess is: USUAL",
      "To determine our next word, let's analyze the information we have so far:\n\n- On our first guess, we were told that 1 letter in our word is also in the secret word.\n- On our second guess, we were told that 2 letters in our word are also in the secret word.\n- On our third guess, we were again told that 2 letters in our word are also in the secret word.\n- On our fourth guess, we were told that 1 letter in our word is also in the secret word.\n- On our fifth guess, we were again told that 1 letter in our word is also in the secret word.\n- On our sixth guess, we were told that 1 letter in our word is also in the secret word.\n- On our seventh guess, we were told that 1 letter in our word is also in the secret word.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that it is unlikely that any of the letters in our previous guesses intersect with each other. In other words, we have not found any common letters among our guesses so far.\n\nTo increase our chances of finding common letters with the secret word, we need to consider words that share at least one letter with each of our previous guesses. \n\nLet's analyze the previous guesses one by one:\n\n1. results - We were told that 1 letter in this word is in the secret word.\n2. submit - We were told that 2 letters in this word are in the secret word.\n3. STUBS - We were told that 2 letters in this word are in the secret word.\n4. guess - We were told that 1 letter in this word is in the secret word.\n5. guess - We were told that 1 letter in this word is in the secret word.\n6. SUNUP - We were told that 1 letter in this word is in the secret word.\n7. USUAL - We were told that 1 letter in this word is in the secret word.\n\nTo find a common letter among these words, let's list the letters that appear:\n\n- results: r\n- submit: s, m, i, t, u, b\n- STUBS: s, t, u, b\n- guess: g, u, e, s\n- SUNUP: s, u, n, p\n- USUAL: u, s, a, l\n\nFrom this list, we can see that the letter 's' appears in four out of the six words. Therefore, it is likely that the letter 's' could be in the secret word.\n\nNow, considering the word 'results' since it was the first guess and also had a shared letter with the secret word, we can use the letter 's' and try to form a five-letter word.\n\nConsidering all these factors, a reasonable next guess could be the word \"SIRST\".\n\n",

The word \"SUNUP\" has 1 letter that is also in the secret word.\n7. The word \"USUAL\" has 1 letter that is also in the secret word.\n8. The word \"SIRST\" has 1 letter that is also in the secret word.\n\nFrom this information, we can see that the letters \"S\" and \"U\" are common between \"SUNUP\" and \"USUAL\" and have shown up in previous guesses where there was a match with the secret word.\n\nBased on this, we can try to find more words that include those common letters. One possibility could be the word \"SUSPECT\".

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the letter \"O\" is in the secret word.\n\nStep 3: Formulate a new guess:\n- Since we know that the letter \"O\" is in the secret word, we can try to form a five-letter word using the intersection of the letters \"G, A, M, E, O\" and \"C, O, N, D, I, T, I, O, N, S\".

Some examples are:\n\n1. Blush\n2. Slush\n3. Squat\n4.

Additionally, we know that there is at least 1 letter that is in our fourth guess and not in any of our previous guesses.\n\nTo form our next guess, we will take the intersecting letters from our prior guesses.

From the information given, we cannot determine exactly which letters are repeated. However, we can identify potential common letters as follows:\n- From the first guess: ?? (unknown)\n- From the second guess: ?? (unknown)\n- From the third guess: ?? (unknown)\n- From the fourth guess: ???\n- From the fifth guess: ???\n\nStep 3: Considering the possible options\nSince we don't know the exact common letters, we need to think of potential five-letter words that could fit with the given information. Considering the two known shared letters, we can try different combinations. Here are a few examples:\n- From the possible common letters: AB*CD, KL*MN, XY*ZC, PQ*RS, etc.\n\nStep 4: Reviewing the prior responses\nFrom the previous guesses, we received feedback on how many letters in our guess were also in the secret word. Taking this into account, we can narrow down our options:\n- The first three guesses all had 2 shared letters with the secret word.\n- The fourth guess had 1 shared letter.\n- The fifth guess had 1 shared letter.\n\nFrom this information, we can rule out certain possibilities:\n- If the secret word had only 1 shared letter with any of the first three guesses, we would have received a different response (not 2).\n- The fourth and fifth guesses had 1 shared letter each, so any guesses with more or fewer shared letters can be excluded.\n\nStep 5: Making the final guess\nBased on the analysis so far, our final guess should share 2 letters with the secret word.

Since \"e\" appears in the last two guesses, we can use it in the new guess. Similarly, since \"E\" and \"R\" appear in the last two guesses, we can include them as well. \n\nA possible word that includes these letters is \"REEDS\". \n\nTherefore, the next word to be submitted to the other player is \"REEDS\".",

The letters \"r\", \"e\", and \"s\" are also present in several guesses.\n\nStep 2: Generate possible words using the common letters\nUsing the common letters identified in Step 1, we can generate possible five-letter words that could match the secret word:\n\n- GRASS\n- DRESS\n- GEARS\n\nStep 3: Refine the possible words\nTo further narrow down the options, we can consider the feedback from the other player regarding the later guesses:\n\n- Guess 6: \"c\", \"o\", \"d\", \"e\", and \"r\" have 2 letters in the secret word.\n- Guess 7: \"e\", \"r\", \"a\", and \"s\" have 4 letters in the secret word.\n- Guess 8: \"r\", \"e\", and \"s\" have 3 letters in the secret word.\n\nLooking at these hints, we can eliminate the word \"DRESS\" since it has no matching letters with the later guesses.\n\nStep 4: Final guess\nBased on the refined options, we can make our final guess:\n\nGuess: GEARS\n\nThis guess includes the common letters \"g\" and \"s\" from the earlier hints and also matches with the letters \"e\", \"r\", and \"s\" from the later hints.\n\nNow we can submit our guess to the other player.",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses.\n- We have guessed the words \"guess\", \"word\", \"be\", \"CODER\", \"ERASE\", \"REEDS\", and \"player\".\n- In response to these guesses, we were told that there are 2 letters in \"guess\" that are also in the secret word.\n- We were also told that there is 1 letter in \"word\" that is in the secret word.\n- Additionally, we were informed that there are 2 letters in \"CODER\" and 4 letters in \"ERASE\" that are in the secret word.\n- Lastly, we were told that there are 3 letters in \"REEDS\" and 4 letters in \"player\" that are in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identify common letters from the prior guesses.\n- From all the prior guesses, the only common letters that appear in multiple guesses are 'E' and 'R'. These letters appear in \"ERASE\" and \"REEDS\".\n\nStep 3: Generate possible five-letter words using the common letters.\n- We can create multiple five-letter words using the common letters 'E' and 'R'. Here are a few examples: \"ERASE\", \"RENEW\", \"REUSE\", \"STEER\", \"RESET\", etc. \n\nStep 4: Choose a word to submit.\n- Considering the prior guesses and the information we have, there isn't enough information to determine which specific word to submit. However, one option could be to submit the word \"RENEW\" since it uses the common letters 'E' and 'R' and hasn't been guessed yet.\n\nSo, the word to submit is \"RENEW\"."

The other player has not provided any feedback yet, so we don't know how many letters in our guess are in the secret word.\n\nBased on this, we will choose our first guess as \"Plaza\". This is just an initial guess, and we will get feedback from the other player to narrow down our options.\n\nOur first guess is \"Plaza\".",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guess\n\nThe prior guess was \"Plaza\" and the other player informed us that 0 letters in \"Plaza\" are also in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Find the intersection between prior guesses\n\nSince \"Plaza\" had no common letters with the secret word, we cannot use the intersection with this word. Therefore, we need to think of a new strategy. \n\nStep 3: Generate a list of potential words\n\nWe can generate a list of potential words by considering five-letter words that have no letters in common with the prior guess \"Plaza\". Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Krill\n2. Wagon\n3. Frost\n4. Brake\n5. Spade\n\nStep 4: Assess the potential words\n\nNow we need to assess the potential words by considering the information given by the other player. Since we know that the secret word has no letters in common with \"Plaza\", we should select a word that has the highest likelihood of having at least one common letter with the secret word. Let's analyze each potential word:\n\n1. Krill: It does not share any letters with \"Plaza\" either, so it might not be a good choice.\n2. Wagon: It also does not share any letters with \"Plaza\", so it might not be a good choice.\n3. Frost: It does not have any common letters with \"Plaza\" but could potentially have letters in common with the secret word.\n4. Brake: Similar to \"Frost\", it does not have any common letters with \"Plaza\" but could potentially have letters in common with the secret word.\n5. Spade: It does not share any letters with \"Plaza\" either, so it might not be a good choice.\n\nConsidering the likelihood of having at least one common letter, \"Frost\" and \"Brake\" seem to be the best choices.\n\nStep 5: Final decision\n\nOut of the potential words, \"Frost\" and \"Brake\" have the highest potential for having at least one common letter with the secret word. After considering both options, our final decision will be to guess \"Frost\" as our next word.\n\nFinal guess: Frost",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses\nIn the first guess, \"Plaza,\" zero letters were found in the secret word. \nIn the second guess, \"Frost,\" two letters were found in the secret word. \n\nStep 2: Identify the intersecting letters\nLet's find the letters that are common to both \"Plaza\" and \"Frost\":\n- In \"Plaza,\" there are no common letters since zero were found in the secret word.\n- In \"Frost,\" there are two common letters: 'r' and 's'.\n\nStep 3: Generate a new guess\nUsing the intersecting letters 'r' and 's', we can come up with a new five-letter word for our guess. Here are a few possibilities:\n1. Horse\n2. Serif\n3. Kiosk\n\nOut of the three options, let's choose \"Horse\" as our guess.\n\nFinal guess: Horse",
      "Let's start by listing out the common letters in both \"Frost\" and \"Horse\" to see if we can find a pattern. \n\nFrom \"Frost\" and \"Horse\", we know that the secret word contains at least 2 letters from \"Frost\" and at least 3 letters from \"Horse\". \n\nSince we haven't received any information about specific letter positions, we can assume that the common letters can be in any position. \n\nLooking at the letters in common between \"Frost\" and \"Horse\" (which are \"o\", \"r\", \"s\"), we can try to come up with a word that includes these letters, as well as any additional letters that may already be on the list from our previous guesses. \n\nConsidering that \"Plaza\" had 0 common letters with the secret word, we can eliminate any words that contain the same letters as \"Plaza\". \n\nSo, let's brainstorm words that contain the common letters \"o\", \"r\", \"s\" and any additional letters from the previous guesses. \n\nSome possibilities could be:\n1. Sorts\n2. Roast\n3. Short\n4. Frost (if we're allowed to repeat words, but let's assume not)\n\nSince \"Sorts\" and \"Roast\" haven't been used before, and they contain the common letters \"o\", \"r\", \"s\", let's choose between these two options.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would submit the word \"Sorts\" as my guess to the other player.",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses\nFrom the information provided, we can make the following deductions:\n- The word \"Plaza\" has 0 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"Frost\" has 2 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"Horse\" has 3 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"player\" has 2 letters in common with the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identify common letters\nTo find the common letters among the prior guesses, we can compare them:\n\n- Common letters between \"Frost\" and \"Horse\": There are no common letters between these two words.\n- Common letters between \"Frost\" and \"player\": The common letters are \"r\" and \"o\".\n- Common letters between \"Horse\" and \"player\": The common letters are \"r\" and \"e\".\n\nBased on the common letters identified, the letters \"r\" and \"o\" are present in two of the prior guesses, while the letters \"e\" is common between \"Horse\" and \"player\".\n\nStep 3: Generate potential words\nUsing the common letters identified, we can generate potential words with five letters that include those common letters. Here are some options:\n\n1. Rotor\n2. Retro\n3. Roper\n4. Rotes\n5. Roser\n6. Roset\n7. Store\n8. Sorer\n9. Erose\n10. Errol\n\nStep 4: Evaluate potential words\nTo determine the best word to guess, we need to consider the information provided by the other player. Since they told us that \"Frost\" has 2 letters and \"player\" has 2 letters in common with the secret word, we can eliminate any words from the list that do not have at least 2 common letters with both \"Frost\" and \"player\".\n\nBased on this criteria, we can eliminate words that only have one common letter with either \"Frost\" or \"player\" from our list: Rotes, Roser, Roset, Store, Sorer, Erose, and Errol.\n\nThis leaves us with the following potential words:\n1. Rotor\n2. Retro\n3. Roper\n\nStep 5: Final guess\nSince there is no additional information provided about the common letters between \"Frost\" and \"player\", we can choose any of the remaining potential words as our final guess.\n\nLet's choose \"Rotor\" as our next word to submit to the other player.",

Additionally, we can see that the last three guesses were identical, which suggests a mistake in recording the guesses.\n\nStep 2: Find the common letters:\n\nTo find the common letters among the prior guess words, we need to compare them. Let's compare Plaza, Frost, and Horse:\n\nPlaza: P, L, Z, A - no common letters with any other words.\nFrost: R, O, S, T - common letter 'O' with Horse.\nHorse: H, O, R, S, E - common letters 'R' and 'O' with Frost.\n\nSo the common letters among these words are 'R' and 'O'.\n\nStep 3: Determine the next guess:\n\nSince 'R' and 'O' are the common letters among the prior guesses, we can use these letters to form the next guess. As we don't have any additional information, we need to randomly combine these letters to form a new five-letter word.\n\nLet's try 'ROOST' as the next guess.\n\nStep 4: Submit the next guess:\n\nSubmit the word \"ROOST\" as the next guess to the other player.",

For example, \"swiss,\" \"swing,\" or \"swipe\" are possibilities. However, since \"swirr\" received the same feedback as \"swirl\" on the number of common letters, it makes sense to choose \"swirr\" as the next guess.\n\nStep 6: Make the next guess\nBased on the above analysis, the next word to submit as a guess is \"swirr.\"\n\nNote: This strategy assumes that the secret word doesn't change between turns and that the other player's feedback is accurate.

      "First, let's think about the possible words that could be the secret word. Since we have no prior guesses, all words with five letters are potential candidates.\n\nTo narrow down our options, let's start with a word that has no repeated letters, such as \"apple\". This way, if the other player indicates that there are zero letters in our guess that are also in the secret word, we can eliminate all words with repeated letters from consideration.\n\nIf the other player tells us that there is at least one letter in our guess that is in the secret word, we can then proceed to our next guess. Our next guess should use the intersection of the letters that are in both our prior guess and the secret word.\n\nFor example, if our first guess \"apple\" had one letter in common with the secret word revealed by the other player, and that letter was \"p\", we can proceed with a guess like \"paper\". This guess uses the intersection of the letters \"a\", \"p\", and \"e\" from our first guess, along with the new letter \"r\".\n\nBy iteratively using the intersection of letters from our prior guesses and the information provided by the other player, we can gradually narrow down the possible word options.\n\nSo, for our first guess, let's go with the word \"apple\".",
      "Step 1: Analyze the previous information\nBased on the previous information, we guessed the word \"apple\" and were told that none of the letters in \"apple\" are in the secret word. Therefore, we can conclude that the letters \"a\", \"p\", \"l\", \"e\" are not present in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Determine the intersection of remaining letters\nTo increase our chances of guessing correctly, we should choose a word that includes the remaining letters that were not present in \"apple\". The remaining letters are \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"m\", \"n\", \"o\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"u\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\". Let's look for words that include these letters.\n\nStep 3: Choose a word to guess\nConsidering the remaining letters, a possible word to guess could be \"quick\". This word includes the letters \"q\", \"u\", \"i\", \"c\", \"k\", which are all present in the remaining pool of letters not used in \"apple\".\n\nSubmit the word \"quick\" as the next guess.",
      "Step 1: Analyze the Prior Guesses\nFrom the information given, we know that the word \"apple\" has 0 letters in common with the secret word, and the word \"guess\" has 1 letter in common with the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Find the Intersection\nWe need to find the common letters between the two prior guesses. However, since \"apple\" has no common letters with the secret word, we can ignore it for now. The common letter between \"guess\" and the secret word is 's'.\n\nStep 3: Generate Possible Words\nBased on the common letter 's', we can generate a list of possible five-letter words that contain 's'. Here are a few examples: \n- Basis\n- Cases\n- Costs\n- House\n- Tasks\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the Options\nWe need to choose a word to guess that maximizes our chances of obtaining more information.

Since \"guess\" is the only word that had a letter that is also in the secret word, we only need to consider this word.\n\nThe common letter between \"guess\" and \"guess\" is the letter \"s\".\n\nStep 3: Construct a new word\n\nUsing the common letter \"s\", we can construct a new five-letter word. Let's consider different possibilities:\n\n- s _ _ _ _\n- _ s _ _ _\n- _ _ s _ _\n- _ _ _ s _\n- _ _ _ _ s\n\nSince we don't have any other information about the secret word, we need to consider all possibilities.\n\nStep 4: Choose the next word\n\nConsidering all possibilities, the next word we can submit to the other player could be \"sands\", \"glass\", \"hasty\", \"songs\", or \"steps\". It's important to note that each of these words should be different from any word we have already guessed.\n\nSo, the word we will submit to the other player as our next guess will be \"sands\".",

However, the word \"guess\" has 1 letter that matches with the secret word.\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible common letter:\nSince the word \"guess\" yielded 1 common letter, we need to consider which letter it could be. Unfortunately, without knowing the specific position of the common letter in the secret word, we cannot determine which letter it is.\n\nStep 4: Generate a new word:\nTo maximize the chances of hitting the common letter, we can combine the letters from the word \"guess\" with a new letter that has not been used in any of the previous guesses. \n\nBased on the prior guesses (\"apple,\" \"sands,\" \"socks,\" \"sassy,\" and \"guess\"), let's choose the letter \"q\" as the new letter since it has not been used before.\n\nTherefore, the new word we can submit is \"gusqy\".",
      "Based on the prior guesses and the information provided by the other player, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The word \"apple\" has 0 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"guess\" has 1 letter in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"sands\" has 0 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"socks\" has 0 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"sassy\" has 0 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"gusqy\" has 1 letter in common with the secret word.\n\nTo proceed with our next guess, we need to analyze the intersection of letters among the prior guesses:\n\n- The letters that \"guess\" and \"gusqy\" have in common are 'g'.\n- No other guesses have any common letters with each other.\n\nTherefore, we can use the letter 'g' as a common intersection and form a new word for our next guess. One possible word could be \"grasp\".",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses\n- The word \"apple\" had 0 letters that are also in the secret word.\n- The word \"guess\" had 1 letter that is also in the secret word.\n- The word \"sands\" had 0 letters that are also in the secret word.\n- The word \"socks\" had 0 letters that are also in the secret word.\n- The word \"sassy\" had 0 letters that are also in the secret word.\n- The word \"gusqy\" had 1 letter that is also in the secret word.\n- The word \"grasp\" had 2 letters that are also in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identify common letters\nLooking at the prior guesses, the common letter in \"guess\" and \"gusqy\" is 's'. Therefore, we can assume 's' is likely to be in the secret word.\n\nStep 3: Generate potential words\nGiven that 's' is a potential letter in the secret word, we can think of words that include 's' and try to intersect them with previous guesses:\n- lists (intersecting with \"guess\")\n- sorts (intersecting with \"gusqy\")\n- spats (intersecting with \"grasp\")\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the potential words\n- \"lists\" intersects with \"guess\", but since \"guess\" and \"gusqy\" have already been used as guesses and shared the same outcome, it's best not to repeat them. So we will disregard \"lists\" for now.\n- \"sorts\" intersects with \"gusqy\" and introduces a new letter 'o' that appeared in the prior guesses. So, we have two confirmed letters, 's' and 'o'.\n- \"spats\" intersects with \"grasp\" and introduces a new letter 'p' that appeared in the prior guesses. So, we have three confirmed letters, 's', 'o', and 'p'.\n\nStep 5: Make the final guess\nBased on the analysis above, the word \"spats\" seems like a good guess because it intersects with the prior word \"grasp\" and introduces new letters based on the prior responses.\n\nTherefore, the next word to submit to the other player is \"spats\".",
      "Based on the given prior guesses and their responses, here's our step-by-step approach:\n\n1. For our first guess, we guessed \"apple\" which had zero letters in common with the secret word.\n\n2. For our second guess, we guessed \"guess\" which had one letter in common with the secret word.\n\n3. For our third guess, we repeated the word \"guess\" which had one letter in common with the secret word.\n\n4.

For our seventh guess, we guessed \"gusqy\" which had one letter in common with the secret word.\n\n8. For our eighth guess, we guessed \"grasp\" which had two letters in common with the secret word.\n\n9. For our ninth guess, we guessed \"spats\" which had one letter in common with the secret word.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information we have:\n\n- \"Guess\" and \"gusqy\" both have one letter in common with the secret word, but we don't know which letter it is.\n\n- \"Grasp\" has two letters in common with the secret word, but we don't know which two letters they are.\n\n- \"Spats\" has one letter in common with the secret word, but we don't know which letter it is.\n\nTo maximize the chances of finding the secret word, we can intersect the letters present in both \"guess\" and \"gusqy.\" This will give us a new guess with a higher probability of containing a letter from the secret word.\n\nBy intersecting the letters in \"guess\" (s,g) and \"gusqy\" (g,s), we find that the common letter is \"s.\" \n\nBased on this information, a potential word we can guess is \"glass\" because it contains the common letter \"s\" and it also incorporates the information from our previous guesses.\n\nTherefore, our next guess will be \"glass.\""

Let's assume they say \"3\" letters are correct.\n\nNow, based on this new information, we need to find another word that intersects the letters of our previous guess (\"ample\") and has three letters in common with the secret word.\n\nLet's assume one possible word is \"ample,\" repeating our previous guess. However, since this word has already been guessed, we need to eliminate it from our options. We can continue to generate a list of five-letter words that have three letters in common with \"ample,\" excluding \"ample\" itself.\n\nLet's say we come up with \"ample\" as our third guess. This time, the other player says \"4\" letters are correct.\n\nOnce again, we need to find a word that intersects the letters from our prior guess (\"ample\") and has four letters in common with the secret word.\n\nWe can repeat the process of generating a list of five-letter words that have four letters in common with \"ample\" and choose one randomly. Let's say we randomly select \"ample\" again.\n\nFinally, let's assume the other player reveals that all five letters in our guess are correct.\n\nBased on this information, we have successfully deduced the secret word - \"ample.\"\n\nTo summarize our guesses: \n- Guess 1: \"apple\"\n- Guess 2: \"ample\"\n- Guess 3: \"ample\"\n- Guess 4: \"ample\"\n\nIt is important to note that this guessing strategy might not always guarantee finding the secret word within the fewest possible attempts, as we are randomly selecting words at each step. However, it allows us to continually refine our guesses based on the intersection of letters from prior guesses and the information received.",
      "Based on the information provided, we know that only 1 letter in the previous guess is also in the secret word. To come up with the next guess, we need to find a word that intersects with the letters of the previous guess.\n\nLet's think step by step:\n\n1. Find a word that has an intersection with the previous guess. As we don't know your previous guess, we cannot suggest specific words here. However, you should think of a word that has at least one letter in common with the previous guess.\n\n2. Make sure the word you choose is different from any word you have already guessed. It is essential to keep track of your previous guesses to avoid repetition.\n\n3. Consider the result of the previous guess. If the previous guess had zero letters in common with the secret word, then you can choose any word as your next guess.\n\nRemember, without knowing your previous guess, we can't provide an exact word suggestion. Please use the steps above to come up with your next guess.",
      "Based on the information given, we know that 1 letter in the first word \"received\" is in the secret word and 2 letters in the second word \"guess\" are in the secret word. \n\nTo find a word that combines the letters in both guesses, let's first identify the common letters in both words \"received\" and \"guess\". The common letter is \"e\".\n\nNext, since the second word \"guess\" had two letters in the secret word, we can determine that one of those letters is \"e\". Therefore, we subtract this common letter \"e\" from the previous word \"received\" (which had one letter) to get a new word:\n\n\"receiv\" - \"e\" = \"rciv\"\n\nSo, the new word we will submit to the other player is \"rciv\".\n\nNote: It's important to keep track of which letters are already guessed in previous words to avoid repeating them in the new guess.",
      "First, let's review the information we have so far: \n\n- In the first guess, the other player said that 1 letter in the word \"received\" is also in the secret word. \n- In the second guess, the other player said that 2 letters in the word \"guess\" are also in the secret word. \n- In the third guess, the other player said that 2 letters in the word \"guess\" are also in the secret word. \n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that the letters \"g\" and \"s\" are definitely in the secret word since they appeared in both the second and third guesses. \n\nSince the first guess only had 1 letter in common with the secret word, we can eliminate any letter from the first guess that is not \"g\" or \"s\". \n\nTherefore, the letters \"g\" and \"s\" are the only ones that we can be certain about from the given information. \n\nTo make our next guess, we can use the intersection of the letters \"g\" and \"s\" with other words in our prior guesses to form a new word. \n\nLooking at our previous guesses, we can see that the word \"guess\" is the only one that contains the letters \"g\" and \"s\". Since we want to use the intersection of the letters, we can repeat the word \"guess\" as our next guess. \n\nTherefore, the word we will submit to the other player is \"guess\".",

Our new guess should include these two letters.\n\nConsidering that the word \"sense\" also had 2 letters in common with the secret word, we can deduce that \"e\" is another common letter.\n\nTherefore, a logical next guess would be a five-letter word that includes \"s,\" \"g,\" and \"e\".

However, since the word guess had zero letters in common, we will not include the letter 'g' in our final guess.\n\nUsing the remaining letters 'e', 's', and 's', we can form words like 'see' and 'ses'. However, since we are looking for a five-letter word, these options are not suitable.\n\nConsidering the common letters and the letters already included in the previous guesses, we can try the word 'genes' as our next guess.

For the letter 'z', we don't have any five letter words that contain 'z' and have one letter in common with \"guess\".\n\nFrom this list, we can see that the words \"flash\" and \"grass\" have already been guessed, so let's avoid those.\n\nOut of the remaining options, \"blast\" seems like a reasonable guess since it has not been guessed before and has one letter in common with \"guess\".\n\nTherefore, the word we will submit to the other player is \"blast\".",
      "Step 1: Analyze the information given.\n- The first guess, \"guess\", has 1 letter that is also in the secret word.\n- The second guess, \"blast\", has 0 letters that are also in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identify the common letters between the two guesses.\n- The common letters between \"guess\" and \"blast\" are 's' and 's'.\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible positions of the common letters in the secret word.\n- Since the other player only mentioned the number of common letters but did not provide their positions, we will assume that the common letters can be in any position.\n\nStep 4: Generate a list of possible words that contain the common letters.\n- Using 's' and 's' as common letters, we can generate words like \"grass\", \"glass\", \"class\", \"sassy\", etc.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the probability of each possible word being the secret word.\n- Since the other player did not provide additional information about the positions of the common letters, it is difficult to determine which word is more likely to be the secret word.\n\nStep 6: Make a decision and submit a word as a guess.\n- Based on the given information, a reasonable guess could be \"glass\" as it contains the common letters and does not overlap with the previous guesses.\n\nYour guess: glass",

Therefore, we can only use the letters \"s\" and \"g\" as the intersection.\n\nStep 4: Make a New Guess\n\nBased on the above analysis, a reasonable next guess could be a five-letter word with the letters \"s\" and \"g\" included.

      "Okay, let's start by considering all possible five-letter words. Since we have no prior guesses, we have a wide range of options to begin with. There are over 8,000 five-letter words in English, so we need to narrow down our choices.\n\nOne approach is to focus on words that contain common vowels such as \"a,\" \"e,\" or \"o,\" since these are often present in many words. Let's look for a word that meets this criterion and has a good mix of consonants as well. For example, we could consider the word \"lemon.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the information we receive from the other player after guessing \"lemon.\" If they tell us that one letter in our guess is also in the secret word, we can start to eliminate possibilities. For example, if they say one letter matches, it means that none of the following words can be the secret word: \"beach,\" \"happy,\" \"mango,\" \"tried,\" and so on, as none of these words share a letter with \"lemon.\"\n\nOn the other hand, if they tell us that no letters in our guess match the secret word, we need to take a different approach.

For example, if the other player tells us that 2 letters in our guess are also in the secret word, we know that those two letters are correct.\n\nStep 4: Use the intersection of the letters from our previous guesses to come up with a new guess. This intersection should only include the letters that we know are correct based on the previous response.\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 2-4 until we correctly guess the secret word.\n\nConsidering it's the first guess and we have no prior guesses, let's start with \"GREAT\" as our first guess.",

Let's try each combination:\n\n1. SEAL\n2. SALE\n3. EASE\n4. ELSE\n5. LASE\n6. LEAS\n\nAny of these six words could potentially be the secret word.

Guess: guesses - 1 letter is in the secret word.\n9. Guess: LEAS - 1 letter is in the secret word.\n\nBased on this information, we can observe that each guess we made so far had only 1 letter that matched the secret word.\n\nStep 2:\nNow, let's analyze the previous guesses to find any common letters. The common letters among the previous guesses are:\n\n- s: Appears in guess, choice, Sees, guesses, and LEAS.\n- e: Appears in guess, choice, Easel, and guesses.\n- a: Appears in guess, apple, choice, player, and LEAS.\n\nStep 3:\nBased on the common letters we identified, we can form a new word from the intersection of those letters. In this case, the letters \"s,\" \"e,\" and \"a\" appear in several of our previous guesses.\n\nTherefore, a possible word we can form using those letters is \"ease.\" Let's submit \"ease\" as our next guess.\n\nStep 4:\nSubmit the word \"ease\" to the other player and wait for their response."

      "Step 1: Analyzing the Information\nBased on the feedback from the other player, we know that only 1 letter in our previous guess, ABFB, is also in the secret word. This means that we can eliminate all words that contain more than 1 letter in common with ABFB.\n\nStep 2: Generating Possible Words\nTo generate possible words, we can list out all the five-letter words that have only 1 letter in common with ABFB. Here are a few examples:\n- METER\n- AXIAL\n- CRAFT\n- FRISK\n- GRAVE\n- GLAZE\n- SKATE\n\nStep 3: Considering Additional Information\nUnfortunately, without any additional information about the secret word, we cannot narrow down our possibilities further. We can only make educated guesses based on the words that have 1 letter in common with ABFB.\n\nStep 4: Making the Next Guess\nFrom the list above, let's choose the word FRISK as our next guess.\n\nNEXT GUESS:\nFRISK",
      "Step 1: Determine the intersection of letters in the prior guesses.\nFrom the prior guesses, we know that the secret word has 1 letter in common with both \"ABFB\" and \"FRISK\".

      "Step 1: Analyze the common letters between the prior guesses\n\nFrom the given information, we know that there is only one letter common between each of the prior guesses (ABFB, FRISK, and FIFTH) and the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Determine the common letter(s)\n\nTo find the intersection of the letters, we can list out the letters in each word:\nABFB: A, B, F\nFRISK: F, R, I, S, K\nFIFTH: F, I, F, T, H\n\nFrom these lists, we can see that the common letter among all three is 'F'.\n\nStep 3: Generate a new guess\n\nTo maximize our chances of getting closer to the secret word, we can try to include the common letter in our next guess. However, since the other player has only confirmed 1 letter in each of our prior guesses, it is not certain if 'F' is actually part of the secret word or if it is just a coincidence.\n\nTo cover all possibilities, we can create a new five-letter word that includes 'F' and also includes other letters not yet used in our prior guesses.\n\nOne possible word that satisfies these conditions is 'FIRED'. It contains 'F' from the common letter and also includes 'I', 'R', 'E', and 'D', which are not yet used in any of our prior guesses.\n\nTherefore, we can submit the word 'FIRED' as our next guess.\n\nStep 4: Submit the word\n\nFIRED",
      "Step 1: Analyzing the prior guesses\n\nBased on the prior guesses, we can conclude the following:\n\n1. The secret word has at least one letter that is also in the word \"ABFB\".\n2.

The secret word has at least two letters that are also in the word \"FIRED\".\n\nStep 2: Finding the intersecting letters\n\nNow, let's find the letters that intersect in all four words to narrow down our possibilities:\n\nABFB: A, B, F\nFRISK: F, R, S, I, K\nFIFTH: F, I, T, H\nFIRED: F, I, R, E, D\n\nThe letters that intersect in all four words are: F, I.\n\nStep 3: Generating a five-letter word\n\nUsing the intersecting letters (F, I), let's try to come up with a five-letter word for our next guess. Some examples include:\n\n1. FILTH\n2. FIFER\n3. FIRES\n4. FIRST\n\nStep 4: Deciding on a guess\n\nSince the other player told us that 2 letters in our previous guess, \"FIRED,\" are also in the secret word, we can eliminate \"FIRES\" and \"FIRST\" as options. Therefore, we are left with two possible guesses:\n\n1. FILTH\n2. FIFER\n\nBoth of these words contain the intersecting letters (F, I), but we do not have enough information to determine which one is more likely to be the secret word. \n\nStep 5: Final guess\n\nBased on the available information, we have narrowed down our choices to \"FILTH\" and \"FIFER.\" We will randomly choose one of them as our final guess.\n\nFinal guess: FIFER",
      "Step 1: Analyze Prior Guesses\nLet's analyze our prior guesses to see if we can find any intersecting letters that are present in all of them.\n\n1. ABFB -> 1 intersecting letter\n2. FRISK -> 1 intersecting letter\n3. FIFTH -> 1 intersecting letter\n4. FIRED -> 2 intersecting letters\n5. FIFER -> 2 intersecting letters\n\nStep 2: Identify the Intersecting Letters\nFrom the given prior guesses, we can see that the letters \"F\" and \"I\" are present in all the words. We can also see that the letters \"F\" and \"E\" are common in the last two words. Therefore, we can consider using these intersecting letters in our next guess.\n\nStep 3: Generate Possible Words\nUsing the intersecting letters \"F\" and \"I,\" we can generate a list of possible five-letter words that might include the secret word. Here are a few examples: \n\n1. FIFES\n2. FIFTH\n3. FIEND\n4. FIELD\n5. FIFER\n6. FIERY\n\nStep 4: Evaluate Possible Words\nNow, we need to evaluate each possible word based on the information we have received so far. \n\n1. FIFES -> We haven't used this word yet, so it could be a potential guess.\n2. FIFTH -> We have used this word before, and it only has 1 intersecting letter, so it is not a good choice for our next guess.\n3. FIEND -> We haven't used this word yet, so it could be a potential guess.\n4. FIELD -> We haven't used this word yet, so it could be a potential guess.\n5. FIFER -> We have used this word before, and it has 2 intersecting letters, so it is not a good choice for our next guess.\n6. FIERY -> We haven't used this word yet, so it could be a potential guess.\n\nStep 5: Choose the Next Guess\nBased on our evaluation, we have three potential words: FIFES, FIEND, and FIELD. Among these options, let's choose \"FIELD\" as our next guess.\n\nNext Guess: FIELD",
      "Let's analyze the information we have so far. From the prior guesses, we know that the secret word has at least two letters in common with each of the words ABFB, FRISK, FIFTH, FIRED, FIFER, and FIELD. \n\nTo find the common letters among all these words, we can compare them letter by letter:\n\nABFB -> ABF_\nFRISK -> FRI_\nFIFTH -> FIF_\nFIRED -> FI_D\nFIFER -> FIF_\nFIELD -> FIE__\n\nFrom this comparison, we can see that the letters A, F, and I are common among all the words. \n\nNow, to make our next guess, we want to use an intersection of these common letters A, F, and I along with any additional letters that haven't been used in the previous guesses.\n\nSince FIFER and FIELD already have two common letters with the secret word, we can use those as the base of our next guess.\n\nLet's consider words that start with \"FIFE\" since it maximizes the common letters used:\n\nFIFER -> FIF_\nFIELD -> FIE_\n\nBy using the letters F, I, E, and one of the remaining letters (A or R), we can create a new guess: FIFAR.\n\nTherefore, the word we will submit to the other player is FIFAR.",
      "Step 1: Review the prior guesses and their results\n\n- ABFB: 1 letter in common with the secret word\n- FRISK: 1 letter in common with the secret word\n- FIFTH: 1 letter in common with the secret word\n- FIRED: 2 letters in common with the secret word\n- FIFER: 2 letters in common with the secret word\n- FIELD: 2 letters in common with the secret word\n- FIFAR: 1 letter in common with the secret word\n\nStep 2: Identify the letters that are common to the prior guesses\n\nLooking at the prior guesses, we see that the letters \"F\" and \"I\" are common to all of them. Therefore, these letters are the only ones we can include in the next guess.\n\nStep 3: Generate a new word using the common letters\n\nUsing the common letters \"F\" and \"I,\" we can come up with the word \"FIRFI\" as our next guess.\n\nStep 4: Submit the word \"FIRFI\" as the next guess\n\nFIRFI",
      "Step 1: Analyzing the Prior Guesses\nFrom the prior guesses and feedback, we can see that:\n- NONE of the letters from the words ABFB, FRISK, FIFTH, FIFAR, and FIRFI are in the secret word.\n- The words FIRED, FIFER, and FIELD all have 2 letters in common with the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identifying Common Letters\nTo find the intersection of letters from FIRED, FIFER, and FIELD, we can compare the letters in each word.\n\n- FIRED: F, I, R, E, D\n- FIFER: F, I, F, E, R\n- FIELD: F, I, E, L, D\n\nThe letters that appear in all three words are: F, I, E.\n\nStep 3: Generating a New Word\nUsing the common letters (F, I, and E), we can create new five-letter words:\n\n- FIEFS\n- FIFES\n\nStep 4: Choosing the Word to Guess\nSince FIEFS and FIFES are the only two options that use the common letters, we need to select one.\n\nConsidering that the prior guesses have failed to provide a clear pattern, it is difficult to determine which word is more likely to be correct. Therefore, let's choose one option arbitrarily.\n\nWord to Guess: FIEFS",
      "Step 1: Analyze the Prior Guesses\n\nLooking at the prior guesses, we can see that the secret word has at least one letter in common with each guess. We can also observe that the letters \"F\" and \"I\" are present in multiple guesses, indicating that these letters are likely present in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Find the Intersection of Common Letters\n\nTo make our next guess, we need to identify the common letters among the prior guesses. Based on the information provided, the only letters that appear in all of the prior guesses are \"F\" and \"I\". Therefore, our next guess should include these two letters.\n\nStep 3: Generate Possible Word Options\n\nUsing the letters \"F\" and \"I\", we can come up with some potential word options:\n1. FIFTH\n2. FIFER\n3. FIELD\n4. FIEFS\n5. FIREFIGHT\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the Likelihood of Each Option\n\nConsidering the information given, we can assess the likelihood of each potential word:\n- FIFTH: Previously guessed with only 1 letter in common with the secret word, so it is likely incorrect.\n- FIFER: Previously guessed with 2 letters in common with the secret word, so it could be a good option.\n- FIELD: Previously guessed with 2 letters in common with the secret word, so it could also be a good option.\n- FIEFS: Previously guessed with 2 letters in common with the secret word, so it is a reasonable choice.\n- FIREFIGHT: This is a guess with the maximum use of the common letters \"F\" and \"I.\" Although it is a longer word, it is a possibility considering the prior feedback.\n\nStep 5: Final Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, we have two reasonable options: FIFER and FIELD. Both words have been guessed before with 2 letters in common with the secret word. As we want to use an intersection of letters from prior guesses, we can choose the word FIFER as our next guess.\n\nFinal Guess: FIFER"

Based on this feedback, we can eliminate words that do not match the given count.\n\nFor example, if the first guess is \"apple\" and the other player says that two letters in the guess are also in the secret word, we can eliminate all the words that do not have two common letters with \"apple\". Let's assume we eliminate \"smile\" and \"table\" based on this feedback.\n\nStep 3: Consider the remaining words and create a new guess.\n\nBased on the remaining words from step 2, we can look for similarities in their letters. For example, if \"chair\" and \"house\" are the only remaining words, we can see that both words have the letter 'h' in common. So, we can use the intersection of common letters from these words to create our next guess.\n\nIn this case, our next guess could be \"habit\". \n\nStep 4: Repeat the process until the secret word is found or we run out of words.\n\nKeep repeating steps 2 and 3, eliminating words based on feedback and creating new guesses using the remaining words and their common letters, until we either find the secret word or have no more words to guess.\n\nSo, the word \"habit\" will be our first guess.",

Any common letters we find can be used to construct our next guess.\n\nLet's assume the secret word is \"apple\". We can see that the letter \"p\" is common between our guess and the secret word.\n\nUsing this information, our next guess could be \"ample\" or any other word that contains the letter \"p\" and has a length of 5.\n\nSo our next guess will be:\n\n2. ample",

We only know that the secret word has at least 1 letter in common with \"guess\" and at least 2 letters in common with \"ample\".\n\nStep 4: Make an educated guess.\n\nBased on the limited information we have, let's make an educated guess. Among the possible five-letter words that include the common letter \"e\", \"sense\" seems like a reasonable choice. It has a different combination of letters compared to the prior guesses, and it could potentially satisfy the given information.\n\nTherefore, our guess will be \"sense\".",

Without additional information, we don't know which specific letter is correct.\n\nIn the second guess, the word \"ample,\" the other player told you that 2 letters in your guess are also in the secret word.\n\nIn the third guess, the word \"sense,\" the other player told you that 2 letters in your guess are also in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Find the intersection of letters in the two overlapping words\n\nTo increase the chances of finding the correct letters, we should focus on the overlapping letters between the second and third guesses (\"ample\" and \"sense\"). Both words share the letters \"s\" and \"e.\"\n\nStep 3: Construct a new word that includes the common letters\n\nUsing the letters \"s\" and \"e\" from the overlapping words, we can form a new word like \"sees\" or \"seesaw.\"\n\nConsidering that \"seesaw\" is a five-letter word, we can choose it as our next guess.\n\nFinal Guess: seesaw",

However, since we already used these letters in our previous guesses, we cannot use them again. \n\nTherefore, we need to find another letter that is present in at least two of our prior guesses. Looking at the letters \"a\" and \"m\" from \"ample\" and \"guess,\" we can see that these two letters are not used in our previous guesses. \n\nHence, a possible word that we can submit to the other player is \"amuse\" which contains the letters \"a\" and \"m\". \n\nPlease note that this is just one possible word that satisfies the given conditions.

The third guess, \"sense,\" also had 2 letters in common with the secret word.\n4. The fourth guess, \"seesaw,\" also had 2 letters in common with the secret word.\n5. The fifth guess, \"well,\" also had 2 letters in common with the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Finding Intersection\n\nTo find a common overlap between all previous guesses, we need to look for letters that appear in the same positions in the words \"ample,\" \"sense,\" \"seesaw,\" and \"well.\" This will help us understand which letters are potential candidates for the secret word.\n\nAnalyzing the words \"ample,\" \"sense,\" \"seesaw,\" and \"well,\" we can compare the letters in each position of the words:\n\n1st position: a s s w\n2nd position: m e e e\n3rd position: p n s l\n4th position: l s e l\n5th position: e e n l\n\nFrom this comparison, we can see that the 2nd and 3rd positions have common letters \"s\" and \"e.\"\n\nStep 3: Making a New Guess\n\nBased on the intersection we found in Step 2, we can construct a new guess that includes the letters \"s\" and \"e\" at the correct positions.

In this case, we need to choose a new word that is completely different from our previous guess.\n\nHowever, if they say, for example, \"2\", it means two letters in our guess are present in the secret word. In this case, we can try to narrow down the possibilities further. We can look for five-letter words that intersect with the letters in our prior guess, but are different from our previous guess. For example, if our first guess was \"ABCDE\", and the response was \"2\", we can try words like \"ACDEF\", \"ABCEF\", \"ABCDF\", etc.\n\nSince we have no prior guesses, our first word should cover all possibilities: \"ABCDE\".",
      "First, let's list all the letters that are in each of our prior guesses: A, B, C, D, E. Since the other player told us that none of these letters are in the secret word, we need to try a different combination.\n\nLet's start by focusing on one letter from our prior guesses: A. We will create a new guess using this letter as the first letter.\n\nNext, let's think about the remaining four letters. We want to choose letters that are different from each other to maximize our chances of finding a letter that is in the secret word. Let's choose B, C, D, and E as our remaining letters.\n\nNow, let's arrange these letters to form a new five-letter word. One possible word we can make is \"ABCDE\".\n\nSo, the word we will submit to the other player is \"ABCDE\".",

Based on our prior guesses, which were both ABCDE, we know that none of the letters in that word are present in the secret word.\n\nTo find a new word to guess, we can look for a common intersection between the letters in our prior guesses. However, since both prior guesses had zero letters in common with the secret word, using an intersection of those letters would not be helpful in this case.\n\nTherefore, we need to think of a completely different word to guess. Let's choose a five-letter word that does not contain any of the letters A, B, C, D, or E. \n\nOne possible option could be FGHIJ.\n\nThis will be our new guess: FGHIJ.",

Instead, we need to find a new word to guess.\n\nConsidering that the secret word is five letters long, let's try to come up with a new guess that has one letter in common with \"FGHIJ\" but is different from all previous guesses.\n\nA possible next guess could be \"KLMNO\". This guess incorporates one letter from the previous guess \"FGHIJ\" (letter 'O').\n\nSo, the next word to submit to the other player is \"KLMNO\".",
      "Step 1: Analyze the previous guesses\n\nIn the prior guesses, we submitted the words \"ABCDE\", \"ABCDE\", \"FGHIJ\", and \"KLMNO\".

Since these letters have consistently appeared in all the prior guesses, they are the most likely candidates to be part of the secret word.\n\nStep 3: Generate possible five-letter words using the common letters:\nWith the common letters identified, we can now generate possible five-letter words using those letters. For example, options could be \"apple\", \"pearl\", \"plead\", \"lapel\", among others.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the possibilities:\nTo narrow down the options, we need additional information.

From the word \"guess,\" we can also identify the letter \"S\" as a common letter.\n\nStep 4: Identifying potential common letters\nBased on the analysis above, the potential common letters in the secret word could be J, D, E, and S.\n\nStep 5: Forming a new word guess\nTo form a new word guess, we can use the intersection of the potential common letters identified above: J, D, E, and S. One word that fits this criteria is \"JADES.\"\n\nStep 6: Final word guess\nThe final word guess to submit to the other player is \"JADES.\"",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses\n- Camel: 0 letters in common with the secret word\n- Judge: 2 letters in common with the secret word\n- Letters: 0 letters in common with the secret word\n- Teeth: 0 letters in common with the secret word\n- Eagle: 0 letters in common with the secret word\n- Word: 2 letters in common with the secret word\n- AJEED: 1 letter in common with the secret word\n- Guess: 1 letter in common with the secret word\n- JADES: 1 letter in common with the secret word\n\nStep 2: Find the intersection of common letters\nBased on the given information, the letters 'J', 'D', and 'E' appear in both \"Judge,\" \"Word,\" \"AJEED,\" \"Guess,\" and \"JADES.\" \n\nStep 3: Generate a new word using the common letters\nLet's form a word using the letters 'J', 'D', and 'E.' One possible word is \"JUDGE.\" However, since we have already guessed \"Judge\" and it had 2 letters in common, we can eliminate it as a possibility. \n\nAnother word we can create using the common letters is \"JADE.\" Since the common letters 'J', 'D', and 'E' have all appeared in the previous guesses, it is reasonable to assume that these letters are part of the secret word. Therefore, \"JADE\" seems like a plausible choice.\n\nStep 4: Submitting the word\nThe word to be submitted to the other player is \"JADE.\""

Some examples are:\n\n- Using the letter \"e\" (which appears in both \"guess\" and \"Grind\"):\n  - Peace\n  - Deeds\n  - Queen\n\n- Using the letter \"h\" (which appears in both \"guess\" and \"Grind\"):\n  - March\n  - Watch\n\n- Using both \"e\" and \"h\":\n  - Beach\n\nStep 3: Choose the best word:\n\nSince there is limited information available, and the number of common letters is consistently 1, it is difficult to determine the exact word. However, based on the intersecting letters, the word \"Beach\" seems like a reasonable guess.\n\nOverall, the word to submit would be \"Beach\".",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses and their intersections with the secret word.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can see that each of the prior guesses has only one letter that is also in the secret word.

Therefore, 's' is the only letter we can be certain of being part of the secret word.\n\nStep 3: Formulate the next guess.\n\nSince we have determined that 's' is part of the secret word, we need to come up with a five-letter word that includes 's' and has four other unknown letters. Let's choose the word \"stars\" as our next guess.\n\nStep 4: Final Guess\n\nSubmit the word \"stars\" as our final guess to the other player.\n\nRemember, this is just one possible approach based on the information given.

In the second guess, the other player also told us that 1 letter in guess is also in the secret word.\n3. In the third guess, the other player told us that 1 letter in Grind is also in the secret word.\n4. In the fourth guess, the other player told us that 1 letter in guess is also in the secret word.\n5. In the fifth guess, the other player told us that 1 letter in Beach is also in the secret word.\n6. In the sixth guess, the other player told us that 1 letter in far is also in the secret word.\n\nBased on this information, we can see that all our previous guesses only had 1 letter in common with the secret word. Therefore, we can try to find the intersection of these letters and come up with a new guess.\n\nIntersecting the letters in \"guess,\" \"Grind,\" \"Beach,\" and \"far\" gives us the letter \"g.\" So, we can use this letter in our next guess.\n\nNow, let's come up with a five-letter word that includes the letter \"g.\" One possible word could be \"begin.\"\n\nTherefore, the word we will submit to the other player is \"begin.\"",

This means that the secret word does not contain any repeated letters. \n\nStep 2: Find the intersecting letters\nTaking the intersection of the letters that appeared in each of the prior guesses, we find that the only letter common to all the guesses is 'e'.\n\nStep 3: Brainstorm possible words\nNow let's generate a list of five-letter words that contain the letter 'e' and do not repeat any letters. Some possibilities could be:\n- Reeds\n- Trees\n- Deems\n- Theme\n- Lease\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options\nSince we only have one guess left, we need to consider which word is the most likely to be the secret word. Given the limited information we have, it's difficult to make a definitive choice. However, considering that 'e' has consistently appeared in the prior guesses, words like \"Reeds\" or \"Trees\" could be plausible options.\n\nFinal guess: Reeds",

      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses\nFrom the information given, it seems that the word we are looking for has two letters in common with each of the previously guessed words - \"player\", \"apple\", and \"place\".\n\nStep 2: Identify the common letters\nTo find the letters that are present in all three words, we can take the intersection of the letters. From the prior guesses, we have the following common letters: \"l\" and \"e\".\n\nStep 3: Generate a five-letter word using the common letters\nUsing the common letters \"l\" and \"e\", we can try to form a five-letter word. Some possibilities could be \"level\", \"hello\", \"elder\", or \"excel\".\n\nStep 4: Consider the feedback given\nHowever, it is important to note that the other player has not given any information about the position or arrangement of the common letters in their response.

We can try to guess a word based on the common letters \"l\" and \"e\" and any other educated assumptions, but it will be a speculative guess rather than an informed one.\n\nFor the next guess, we can try the word \"lemon\" which still utilizes the common letters \"l\" and \"e\".",

However, since we already know that \"apple\" and \"place\" have only 2 letters in common with the secret word, it is unlikely to be any of those words.\n\nStep 4: Check remaining options\nTo narrow down the possibilities, we need to consider the letters that are not common in all the prior guesses. In this case, the only letter that doesn't appear in all the prior guesses is \"a\". Therefore, we can eliminate words that contain the letter \"a\" from our options.\n\nStep 5: Final guess\nBased on the analysis and eliminating words containing \"a\", our final guess could be \"repel.\"\n\nFinal Guess: repel",

Let's generate some five-letter words with one of the letters from \"event\" in different positions: \n  - \"eleme\", \"sevent\", \"sevee\", \"events\", \"money\", \"sever\", \"eleve\", etc.\n\nStep 4: Consider potential words that have not been guessed before:\n- In order to come up with a new guess, we should avoid using words that have already been guessed. We need to ensure that our new guess is different from \"guess\" and \"event\".\n\nStep 5: Final guess:\n- Based on the above steps, a possible word that has not been guessed yet and contains one correct letter is \"sever\". \n\nTherefore, the word we will submit to the other player is \"sever\".",

Let's try to form a five-letter word using \"e\" and other letters as well.\n\nOne possible word that we can form is \"ether\".\n\nStep 4: Submit the new word as your guess:\nYou should submit the word \"ether\" to the other player.",

Some possible options could be:\n\n1. Enrol\n2. Error\n3. Enter\n4. Ember\n5.

The only remaining common letter among all the guesses is \"P\" from the word \"player,\" which had two letters in common with the secret word.

      "Step 1: Analyze prior guesses\nBased on the information provided, we can determine the following about the secret word:\n- The word \"guess\" has 2 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"G\" has 0 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"TIRED\" has 3 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"BEACH\" has 1 letter in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"GESSE\" has 2 letters in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"GUTBE\" has 2 letters in common with the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identify common letters\nBy comparing the prior guesses, we can find the letters that are common to all of them. In this case, there are no common letters in all of the prior guesses. However, we can still consider the letters that were common in most of them.\n\nThe letters common to multiple guesses are:\n- \"G\" (common to \"G\" and \"GESSE\")\n- \"E\" (common to \"BEACH\" and \"GESSE\")\n- \"S\" (common to \"GESSE\" and \"GUTBE\")\n\nStep 3: Formulate a new guess\nSince the word \"G\" has 0 letters in common with the secret word, we need to find a new word that includes the letters \"G,\" \"E,\" and \"S\" while avoiding the letters already used in the prior guesses. Let's try the word \"GASSES\" as our new guess.\n\nStep 4: Submit the new guess\nYou will submit the word \"GASSES\" as your guess to the other player.",

GESSE - 2 letters in GESSE are also in the secret word.\n7. GUTBE - 2 letters in GUTBE are also in the secret word.\n8. player - 1 letter in player is also in the secret word.\n\nFrom the given information, we can deduce that the letters \"E\" and \"S\" are definitely in the secret word since they appeared in multiple guesses. \n\nAdditionally, we know that the letters \"R\", \"D\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", and \"H\" have all been mentioned at least once, either in prior guesses or in the secret word itself.\n\nConsidering these observations, we can come up with a potential word that combines the confirmed letters \"E\" and \"S\" with some of the other mentioned letters. One option could be the word \"HERBS\". \n\nNote: Since the given information is limited, there could be other valid words that satisfy the conditions.",

Let's try:\n1) \"SETS\" - This word includes all four letters that have been identified. \n\nSince \"SETS\" is a valid guess, we can submit it to the other player."

Since we don't have any prior guesses in this scenario, we can use a common list of five-letter words to begin with. There are several online resources or word databases that provide such lists.\n\nStep 2: Choose a word that covers a wide range of possibilities\n\nSince we have no prior information about the secret word, it is best to choose a word that covers a wide range of possibilities in terms of the letters it contains. This way, we can narrow down the options more quickly with each response from the other player. \n\nLet's choose the word \"RAVEN\" as our first guess. It contains a good mix of different letters (R, A, V, E, N), covering all different possibilities.\n\nStep 3: Process the response and update our guesses\n\nAfter submitting our guess, the other player will tell us how many letters in our guess are also in the secret word.

Since \"guess\" is our only prior guess, the intersection is simply the letters that are in both \"guess\" and \"guess.\" In this case, all letters in \"guess\" are in \"guess\" itself.\n\nNow, we need to consider whether the word we guessed had zero letters that are also in the secret word. Since we were told that 2 letters in \"guess\" are in the secret word, it means that \"guess\" is not the correct word. \n\nGiven this information, we need to make a new guess using the intersection of the letters in \"guess\" (which is \"guess\" itself) with the letters in our new guess.\n\nConsidering that the new guess should be a five-letter word, let's try the word \"words\" as our new guess.

The word \"grass\" had 2 letters that are also in the secret word.\n\nBased on this information, we can determine that the common letter in both \"guess\" and \"grass\" is the letter \"s\".\n\nNow, we need to think about possible words that contain the letter \"s\" and have a length of five letters. Here are a few options to consider:\n- Sands\n- Dress\n- Steps\n- Stars\n\nOut of these options, the most logical guess would be \"Stars\" since it contains the letter \"s\" which is confirmed to be part of the secret word.\n\nTherefore, the word I will submit to the other player is \"Stars\".",

Since the first guess had 0 letters that are also in the secret word, we cannot use any letters from that guess in our new guess. \n\nLet's identify the letters that are common to the second (\"guess\") and third (\"guess\" again) guesses. The only common letter is \"g\". \n\nNow, let's identify the letters that are common to the fourth (\"grass\") and fifth (\"Stars\") guesses. The common letters are \"s\" and \"r\".\n\nBy considering these common letters, a potential word that we could guess is \"gras\". This word uses the \"g\" from the second and third guesses, and the \"s\" and \"r\" from the fourth and fifth guesses.\n\nTherefore, the next word you should submit to the other player is \"gras\".",

From the given information, we can identify the intersecting letters as \"g\" since it appears in both \"grass\" and \"guess.\"\n\nStep 3: Generate new word\nUsing the intersecting letters, we can generate a new word. Let's combine the intersecting letters \"g\" with any other letter. For simplicity, let's choose \"a\" as the second letter.\n\nConsidering the previous guesses, we can choose \"a\" because it was present in \"grass.\" However, we need to ensure that the new word remains unique and hasn't been guessed before.\n\nSince \"ga\" is a new combination and hasn't been guessed before, let's use it as the beginning of our new guess.\n\nStep 4: Submitting the new word\nNow that we have our new word, \"ga,\" let's submit it as our guess to the other player.\n\nNew word: ga\n\nNote: Remember to ensure that the new guess is different from any previous guesses.",

Based on the provided information, the common letters among the previous guesses are 's' and 's'.\n\nTherefore, a word that intersects with all previous guesses and has the common letters 's' and 's' is \"glass\". We can submit \"glass\" as our next guess.",

The word TRAIT has 2 letters that are also in the secret word.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that the common letters in TIGER and TRAIT are 'T' and 'I'. \n\nSince the word player has only 1 letter in common, it means that the common letter must be either 'P', 'L', 'A', or 'Y'.

We'll use this information to make an informed decision for our next guess.\n\n1. Bread - If the secret word contains the letter 'a', then there is one letter in common.\n2. Frown - If the secret word contains the letters 'r' and 'o', then there are two letters in common.\n3. Grasp - If the secret word contains the letter 'r', then there is one letter in common.\n4. Mirth - If the secret word contains the letter 'r', then there is one letter in common.\n5. Plant - If the secret word contains the letter 'r', then there is one letter in common.\n\nBased on the analysis, it seems that the letter 'r' is likely to be in the secret word. Therefore, our next guess should include the letter 'r', along with an intersection of the common letters in our previous guesses.\n\nLet's choose the word \"Crown\" as our next guess. It contains the letter 'r' and also intersects with the letters 'o' and 'n' from our previous guesses.\n\nPRIOR GUESSES:\n1. Bread\n2. Frown\n3. Grasp\n4. Mirth\n5. Plant\n\nCURRENT GUESS:\n6. Crown",
      "Step 1: Analyze the Prior Guess\nIn the prior guess, the other player told you that 1 letter in the word \"Crown\" is also in the secret word. This means that we have one correct letter in the correct position.\n\nStep 2: Identify Potential Words\nNow, we need to find a word that shares the same letter in the correct position as \"Crown\" and also intersects with the remaining letters of the previous guesses. Let's list down some potential words that fit this criteria:\n1. Brown\n2. Grown\n3. Drown\n4. Clown\n5. Frown\n\nStep 3: Evaluate Potential Words\nSince we are looking for a five-letter word, we need to analyze each potential word and see if it fits with the prior guess. Let's go through each word:\n\n1. Brown: Shares the same letter 'r' as \"Crown\" in the correct position.\n2. Grown: Shares the same letter 'r' as \"Crown\" in the correct position.\n3. Drown: Shares the same letter 'r' as \"Crown\" in the correct position.\n4. Clown: Shares the same letter 'o' as \"Crown\" in the correct position, but we've already used 'r' from the prior guess, so this word is not a valid option.\n5. Frown: Shares the same letter 'r' as \"Crown\" in the correct position.\n\nStep 4: Make the Guess\nBased on our analysis, the best guess would be \"Grown\" since it shares the same letter 'r' as \"Crown\" in the correct position. Therefore, the word you should submit to the other player is \"Grown\".",
      "Step 1: Analyze the information given\nWe know that when we guessed the word \"Crown\", there was 1 letter that is also in the secret word. Then, when we guessed the word \"Grown\", there was again 1 letter that is also in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Find the intersection of the letters\nTo find the common letters between \"Crown\" and \"Grown\", we can take the intersection of the two words. The common letter is \"r\".\n\nStep 3: Formulate a new word\nWe need to come up with a five-letter word that includes the common letter \"r\". Since we don't have any other information about the secret word, we can guess a word that includes \"r\" and try to cover all possibilities. Let's guess the word \"Fruit\".\n\nStep 4: Submit the new word\nThe word we will submit to the other player is \"Fruit\".",
      "Step 1: Analyze prior guesses\n- We submitted the word \"Crown\" and were told that 1 letter is also in the secret word.\n- We submitted the word \"Grown\" and received the same information, 1 letter in common.\n- We submitted the word \"Fruit\" and once again told that 1 letter is in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identify the common letters\nFrom the information provided, we can determine that there is at least 1 letter common to all three words. Let's find the common letters by comparing the words:\n\n- \"Crown\" has the letter 'n' in common with \"Grown\" and \"Fruit\".\n- \"Grown\" has the letter 'n' in common with \"Crown\" and \"Fruit\".\n- \"Fruit\" has the letter 'r' in common with \"Crown\" and \"Grown\".\n\nSo, the common letters among these three words are 'n' and 'r'.\n\nStep 3: Guess a word using the common letters\nBased on the common letters 'n' and 'r', we can try to form a new five-letter word:\n- Possible words with 'n' and 'r': \"Narrow\", \"Nerve\", \"Nurse\".\n\nOut of these options, we can select \"Narrow\" as our next guess, as it has a different pattern than our previous guesses.\n\nStep 4: Submit our guess\nTherefore, we will submit the word \"Narrow\" as our next guess. Please note that it might not be the correct word, but it utilizes the common letters 'n' and 'r' discovered from the prior guesses.",
      "Step 1: Review the previous guess and responses\nBased on the previous guesses and responses, we can see that each guess had 1 letter that is also in the secret word. This means that there is at least one common letter between each guess and the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identify the common letters\nTo find the common letters, let's compare the previous guesses:\n- Crown: c, r, o, w, n\n- Grown: g, r, o, w, n\n- Fruit: r, i, t, u\n- Guesses: g, u, e, s\n\nFrom these comparisons, we can see that the only common letter among all previous guesses is the letter \"r\".\n\nStep 3: Generate a new guess\nUsing the common letter \"r\", we can create a new five-letter word:\n- Rover\n\nLet's submit the word \"Rover\" as our next guess.",
      "Step 1: Analyze the Prior Guesses\n\nTo find a common intersection among the prior guesses, we need to identify the letters that are present in all of them.

However, we can still use this information to narrow down the possibilities for our next guess.\n\nStep 3: Make the Next Guess\n\nSince the secret word is five letters long, we can guess a word that includes all the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding the known single common letter in the prior guesses). Let's try the word \"black\" as our next guess.\n\nSubmit the word: Black",

In this case, the only common letter among all the prior guesses is the letter 'r'.\n\nStep 3: Generate a new word using the common letter\n\nUsing the common letter 'r', we can try to create a new five-letter word. One possibility could be \"crank\". \n\nStep 4: Submit your guess\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis and the intersection of the common letters, you should submit the word \"crank\" as your guess.",

The word \"Black\" does not share any letters with the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Find the intersection of shared letters\nTo find the intersection of shared letters among all prior guesses, we need to compare the letters in each guess. From the given information, the only letter present in all the prior guesses is 's' (from \"guesses\").\n\nStep 3: Formulate the next guess\nSince \"guesses\" is the only word that shares a letter with the secret word and is also the only word with the highest intersection, we can conclude that the secret word contains the letter 's'. Therefore, our next guess should contain the letter 's'.\n\nGuess: Using the information gathered, our next guess will be a five-letter word that includes the letter 's'.

Since we know that one of the letters is common between our prior guesses and the secret word, we can guess a word using those letters. \n\nA possible new word could be \"rope\" because it includes the letters \"r\", \"o\", and \"e\" which are part of the intersection of the letters from our prior guesses. \n\nNew guess: \"rope\"",

      "Step 1: Analyzing the Prior Guesses\n\nFrom the prior guesses, we know that both \"guess\" and \"blank\" have 1 letter in common with the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Finding the Intersection\n\nLet's determine the common letter between \"guess\" and \"blank\". \n\n- \"guess\" has the letter 's' in common.\n- \"blank\" has the letter 'a' in common. \n\nSince the two words have different common letters, we will take the intersection of these letters to find the potential common letter with the secret word.\n\nThe intersection of 's' and 'a' is an empty set, which means there are no common letters between the two prior guesses.\n\nStep 3: Making a New Guess\n\nSince there are no common letters between the prior guesses, we need to come up with a new guess. Let's create a five-letter word that does not include the letters from the previous guesses.\n\nFor this new guess, let's use the word \"table\".\n\nFinal Guess: table",
      "Step 1: Find the common letters in the prior guesses\n\n- From the information given, we know that 1 letter in each of the prior guesses (guess, blank, table) is also in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Determine the common letters between the prior guesses\n\n- Looking at the prior guesses (guess, blank, table), we can identify the letter \"a\" as the common letter in all of them.\n\nStep 3: Generate a five-letter word using the common letters\n\nThere are several five-letter words that can be formed using the common letter \"a\". Here are a few examples:\n- Alarm\n- Pasta\n- Avant\n- Salad\n\nStep 4: Choose a word that has not been guessed before\n\nSince the game requires each guess to be different from any previous guess, we should choose a word that hasn't been guessed yet. From the prior guesses, we can see that \"guess\", \"blank\", and \"table\" have already been guessed. Therefore, we should choose a word that is different from those.\n\nBased on the available options, let's choose the word \"Alarm\" as our next guess.\n\nYour next guess: Alarm",

The secret word has 0 letters in common with Alarm.\n\nStep 2: Find the Intersection of Common Letters\nTo find the intersection of the letters that are common among all prior guesses, we can compare each guess and identify the common letter(s):\n\n- guess: _ _ _ _ _\n- blank: _ l _ _ _\n- table: _ a _ _ _\n- Alarm: A l a _ _\n\nFrom these comparisons, we can determine that the only letter common to all guesses is \"l\". Therefore, the next guess should contain the letter \"l\".\n\nStep 3: Determine the Next Guess\nConsidering the information gathered so far, we can now make a guess that includes the letter \"l\".

The letters 'l', 'u', 'n', and 'h' seem to be the only common letters.\n\nStep 3: Generate possible five-letter words using the common letters\nUsing the common letters ('l', 'u', 'n', 'h'), we can generate some five-letter words as follows:\n\n1. Lunch\n2. Hunal\n3. Nulls\n4. Hulls\n\nStep 4: Choose a word to submit as the next guess\nSince the word \"lunch\" is the only word from the generated possibilities that has a letter in common with the previous guesses, we should submit \"lunch\" as the next guess.\n\nFinal Answer: Lunch",

To find the intersection, we compare the letters in each guess:\n- \"train\": T, R, A, I, N\n- \"braid\": B, R, A, I, D\n\nThe common letter in both words is \"R\".\n\nStep 3: Construct a new word guess.\nUsing the common letter \"R\", we can construct a new five-letter word guess. Here are a few possible options:\n1. Radii\n2. Radar\n3. Rails\n4. Robin\n\nWe can choose one of these options as our new word guess. Let's go with \"Radar\".\n\nStep 4: Submit the new word guess to the other player.\nOur new word guess is \"Radar\".",
      "First, let's list out the letters that have been confirmed to be in the secret word based on the prior guesses:\n\n- For the first guess, 1 letter from the secret word was in the guess.\n- For the second guess, 1 letter from the secret word was in the guess.\n- For the third guess (Radar), 2 letters from the secret word were in Radar.\n\nBased on this information, we know at least one letter that is in the secret word (since it was present in both the first and second guesses), and we know two specific letters that are in the secret word (since they were present in the third guess).\n\nTo find a word that contains these letters, we can look for five-letter words that have an intersection of the letters present in the first and second guesses, and also contain the two specific letters from the third guess.\n\nHere is a list of five-letter words that match these criteria:\n- Radar (already guessed)\n- Ladar\n- Radix\n- Drape\n- Drape\n- Lader\n- Raker\n- Break\n- Raked\n\nSince Radar has already been guessed and we need to provide a new guess, one possibility could be the word \"Lader.\" This word contains the letter \"a\" (common from the first and second guesses) and the letters \"d\" and \"r\" (specific from the third guess).\n\nTherefore, the word you can submit to the other player is \"Lader.\"",

In the English language, there are 26 letters, so we have to consider all of them as potential letters in the secret word.\n\nStep 3: Select a guess\nTo maximize our chances of finding the secret word, we need to select a guess that includes the most commonly occurring letters in the English language.

Based on the prior guesses, 'S' is the correct letter in the secret word.\n\nStep 4: Submit the new guess\nBased on the above analysis, I would submit the word \"SAILS\" as my guess.\n\nNote: The word \"SAILS\" is just a suggestion based on the given information. It may not be the actual secret word, but it follows the logical approach of using the intersecting letters from the prior guesses.",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses\nFrom the provided information, we can see that each guess has resulted in the other player indicating that only 1 letter from the guess is in the secret word. This suggests that there is a single common letter among all the previous guesses that is also present in the secret word.\n\nTo identify this common letter, let's find the intersection of letters from all the prior guesses:\n- SHORT: S, H, O, R, T\n- DECISION: D, E, C, I, S, O, N\n- GUESS: G, U, E, S\n- SHOT: S, H, O, T\n- HOSES: H, O, S, E\n- STAYS: S, T, A, Y\n- GUESSES: G, U, E, S\n\nThe common letters among all the above guesses are S and O.\n\nStep 2: Identify a word using the common letters\nSince none of the previous guesses had zero letters in common with the secret word, we can use the common letters S and O to form a new word. As the previous guesses have used different combinations of these letters, we can try a word that combines these letters in a new way.\n\nOne possibility is the word \"SOOTH.\" Let's check if this word has 1 letter in common with the secret word.\n\nStep 3: Submit the new word\nYou submitted the word SOOTH.",
      "Step 1: Analyzing the Prior Guesses\nBased on the prior guesses and responses, we can deduce the following:\n- The secret word has at least one letter that is also present in each of the prior guesses.\n- The secret word does not contain any of the letters from the word \"PRIOR\" (since there were 0 matches).\n- The secret word does not contain any of the letters from the word \"SHORT\" (since there were 1 match).\n- The secret word does not contain any of the letters from the word \"DECISION\" (since there were 1 match).\n- The secret word does not contain any of the letters from the word \"GUESS\" (since there were 1 match).\n- The secret word does not contain any of the letters from the word \"SHOT\" (since there were 1 match).\n- The secret word does not contain any of the letters from the word \"HOSES\" (since there were 1 match).\n- The secret word does not contain any of the letters from the word \"STAYS\" (since there were 1 match).\n- The secret word does not contain any of the letters from the word \"GUESSES\" (since there were 1 match).\n- The secret word does not contain any of the letters from the word \"SOOTH\" (since there were 1 match).\n\nStep 2: Finding the Intersection of Valid Letters\nTo create our next guess, we need to find the intersection of all the valid letters from the prior guesses (words that had at least 1 match).\n\nValid letters:\n- S (from SHORT, GUESS, SHOT, HOSES, STAYS)\n- H (from SHORT, SHOT, HOSES, SOOTH)\n- O (from SHORT, SHOT, HOSES, SOOTH)\n- T (from SHORT, STAYS)\n- E (from DECISION)\n- G (from GUESS, GUESSES)\n- U (from GUESS, GUESSES)\n\nTaking the intersection of these letters, we get \"S H O T G U E\".\n\nStep 3: Generating a Guess\nUsing the intersection \"SHOTGUE,\" we can form various five-letter words to guess. Here are a few possibilities:\n1. SHOUT\n2. GHOST\n3. GUEST\n4. GOUTS\n5. TOUGH\n\nSince all of these words are valid based on the prior information, you can choose any of them as your next guess."

One strategy is to choose a word that contains different letters that are not repeated.

Since we want to maximize our chances of intersecting with the secret word, let's choose \"Table\" as our next guess.\n\nNow it's time to submit our guess to the other player:\n\nGUESS: Table",
      "First, let's analyze the information we have so far. We submitted the word \"Table\" and were told that 1 letter in \"Table\" is also in the secret word.\n\nNext, we need to find a word that intersects with the letters in \"Table\" and takes into account the information we received.\n\nLet's list the letters in \"Table\": T, A, B, L, E.\n\nSince we know that only 1 letter in \"Table\" is also in the secret word, we can eliminate any words that have more than 1 intersecting letter.\n\nNow, we need to think of words that have at least 1 letter in common with \"Table\" but also have a different letter compared to our previous guesses.\n\nOne possible word could be \"Scale.\" It shares the letter 'A' with \"Table,\" and 'S' is a different letter compared to our previous guess.\n\nTherefore, our guess for this turn will be \"Scale.\"\n\nNew guess: Scale",
      "Step 1: Analyze the intersection of letters in the prior guesses\n\nIn the prior guesses, the letters 'a', 'e', and 'l' were common between the words 'Table' and 'Scale'. However, since the other player confirmed that only 1 letter in each guess is also in the secret word, it means that the intersection of these letters ('a', 'e', and 'l') is not the letter present in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Find a word that includes the remaining letters not yet guessed\n\nSince the letters 'a', 'e', and 'l' are already eliminated, we need to find a word that includes the remaining letters not yet guessed. \n\nBased on the information given, the other player has not confirmed the presence of any other letter in the secret word. Therefore, we can consider any word that includes letters other than 'a', 'e', and 'l'.\n\nFor example, we can guess the word 'Baker' which includes the letters 'b', 'k', and 'r'.\n\nWord to submit: Baker",
      "Step 1: Analyze the Intersection\nFirst, let's analyze the letters that are common to all three of your prior guesses: Table, Scale, and Baker. The common letter is 'a'. Since all three guesses received a response of 1 letter that is also in the secret word, we can conclude that the secret word contains the letter 'a'. \n\nStep 2: Create a List of Potential Words\nNext, we need to create a list of five-letter words that contain the letter 'a'. Some examples include:\n1. Japan\n2. Salad\n3. Maple\n4. Labor\n5. Pants\n\nStep 3: Consider Previously Eliminated Letters\nNow, let's consider the letters that have already been eliminated through the prior guesses. For example, in Table, Scale, and Baker, the following letters have been eliminated: T, S, C, L, B, and K. Therefore, we should avoid words that contain these letters.\n\nStep 4: Finalize Your Guess\nTaking into consideration the above steps, a possible word to guess could be \"Japan\" since it contains the letter 'a', does not contain any of the previously eliminated letters, and has not been guessed before.\n\nFinal Guess: Japan",
      "Let's analyze the information we have so far:\n- The secret word has 5 letters.\n- Based on our prior guesses, there is only 1 letter in each of our guesses that is also in the secret word.\n- Our previous guesses were: Table, Scale, Baker, and Japan.\n\nSince we know that only 1 letter in each of our guesses matches the secret word, we can look for a common letter that appears in all four of our previous guesses. In this case, the letter 'a' appears in all four words.\n\nNow, let's think about the different combinations of words using the letter 'a' that we can make:\n- Tala (using the 'a' from Table)\n- Sace (using the 'a' from Scale)\n- Baka (using the 'a' from Baker)\n- Jaan (using the 'a' from Japan)\n\nOut of these options, only the word \"Baka\" is a legitimate five-letter word. Therefore, we will submit the word \"Baka\" to the other player as our next guess.\n\nPlease note that \"Baka\" is just a suggestion based on the given information. The actual secret word could be something entirely different, so there is still some uncertainty in our guess.",
      "Step 1: Analyze the clues from the prior guesses.\n\nBased on the information provided, each of the previous guesses (Table, Scale, Baker, Japan, and guess) had only 1 letter in common with the secret word. \n\nStep 2: Find the common letter.\n\nTo determine the common letter in the previous guesses, we need to look for the intersecting letters among them. \n\nBased on the given information, we know that each of these words has at least one letter in common with the secret word. However, we don't have the specific common letter for each guess.\n\nStep 3: Identify the intersecting letters.\n\nWe need to find the letters that are present in each of the previous guesses. From the given information, we can identify the intersecting letters as follows:\n\n- T from Table\n- S from Scale\n- K from Baker\n- J from Japan\n\nStep 4: Guess a word using the intersecting letters.\n\nUtilizing the intersecting letters found in Step 3 (T, S, K, J), we can try to form new words to guess. One possible word could be \"Task,\" as it includes all four intersecting letters.\n\nGuess: Task",
      "First, let's analyze the prior guesses and the information we have received from the other player:\n\n- The words \"Table,\" \"Scale,\" \"Baker,\" \"Japan,\" and \"Task\" all have one letter in common with the secret word.\n- The word \"guess\" has zero letters in common with the secret word.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the common letter among the guesses is unique and distinct from the letters in the word \"guess.\" Therefore, we should not consider the letter \"S\" since it was in the word \"guess.\"\n\nLet's find the intersection of the remaining common letters from the previous guesses: \"T,\" \"A,\" \"B,\" \"L,\" and \"E.\"\n\nSince we don't have any other information, we can try using a general five-letter word that includes one of these common letters. Let's try the word \"Table\" again, as it is the only word from the previous guesses that we know has one letter in common with the secret word.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The word \"Table\" will be the next guess.\n\nPlease note that this reasoning is based strictly on the given information, and there may be other possible solutions.",
      "Step 1: Analyze the Prior Guesses\n\nWe have submitted the following words and received the corresponding responses:\n\n1. Table - 1 letter in Table is also in the secret word.\n2. Scale - 1 letter in Scale is also in the secret word.\n3. Baker - 1 letter in Baker is also in the secret word.\n4. Japan - 1 letter in Japan is also in the secret word.\n5. Guess - 0 letters in Guess are also in the secret word.\n6. Task - 1 letter in Task is also in the secret word.\n7. Solutions - 1 letter in Solutions is also in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identify Common Letters\n\nTo find a word that intersects with all the prior guesses, we need to identify the common letters among them:\n\n1. Table: Does not have any common letters with other words.\n2. Scale: Shares 'a' with Baker, Japan, and Task.\n3. Baker: Shares 'a' with Scale, Japan, and Task.\n4. Japan: Shares 'a' with Scale, Baker, and Task.\n5. Guess: Does not have any common letters with other words.\n6. Task: Shares 'a' with Scale, Baker, and Japan.\n7. Solutions: Shares 'o' with Japan.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the letter 'a' is common among Scale, Baker, and Japan.\n\nStep 3: Propose a New Word\n\nBased on the shared letter 'a' among Scale, Baker, and Japan, we can propose a new word that uses this intersection:\n\nProposal: Pasta\n\nThe word \"Pasta\" has 'a' as a common letter with Scale, Baker, and Japan.",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses.\nFrom the prior guesses, we can see that the common letter(s) in all the correct guesses is 'a'. This means that 'a' is definitely a letter in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm possible words using the common letter 'a'.\nNow, let's brainstorm some new words that include the letter 'a' and are different from any words we have guessed before:\n1. Apple\n2. Crash\n3. Cream\n4. Snake\n5. Alarm\n6. Aware\n7. Plaza\n8. Dream\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the possible words based on the given information.\nWe need to evaluate each possible word based on the previous responses from the other player and eliminate words that do not fit. It is important to note that each correct guess only has 1 letter in common with the secret word.\n\nFrom the prior responses, we can see that 'scale', 'baker', 'table', 'japan', 'task', and 'solutions' all had 1 letter in common with the secret word. Therefore, we can eliminate words that have more than 1 letter in common with these words:\n- Apple (has 2 common letters with 'scale')\n- Crash (has 4 common letters with 'solutions')\n- Snake (has 3 common letters with 'scale' and 'solutions')\n- Plaza (has 2 common letters with 'scale')\n- Dream (has 3 common letters with 'baker' and 'solutions')\n- Aware (has 3 common letters with 'table' and 'solutions')\n\nWe are left with the word 'cream' as a possible submission. It has 1 letter ('a') in common with all the previous guesses and has not been guessed before.\n\nStep 4: Final guess\nBased on the above analysis, the word 'cream' is a potential submission that meets the criteria.",
      "Based on the information provided, we know that each of our prior guesses had only 1 letter that is also in the secret word. Therefore, we can narrow down our options by considering the intersection of the letters in our previous guesses.\n\nIntersection of letters in prior guesses: A\n\nPossible word choices:\n1. Snake\n2. Lake\n3. Late\n\nOut of these options, \"Snake\" seems like the best choice as it has the maximum number of unique letters compared to the other options.

Therefore, \"information\" provides us with the most useful information.\n\nAmong the brainstormed words, \"Smoke\" and \"Drake\" contain the letters \"o\" and \"k\", which are not present in the previous guesses. This means these words are less likely to match the secret word since they have no commonality.\n\nThe most promising word is \"Brake\" since it includes the letters \"a\" and \"k\" from the intersection, and it also shares the letter \"k\" with the previous guess \"black\".\n\nTherefore, the word to be submitted to the other player as the next guess is \"Brake\".",

      "First, let's start by brainstorming a list of five-letter words that could possibly be the secret word. Since we don't have any prior guesses, we can consider any five-letter word at this point. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Apple\n2. Mango\n3. Ghost\n4. House\n5. Happy\n\nNow, let's consider the intersections between these words to narrow down our options. The intersection of two words is the set of letters that appear in both words. Since we don't have any prior guesses, the intersection will be an empty set for all the words above.\n\nNow that we know the intersections are empty, we don't have any common letters with the secret word. So, let's make a guess that does not use any letters from the prior guesses. Since any five-letter word is a valid guess at this point, we can choose any word that comes to our mind. Let's go with:\n\nGuess: Tiger",
      "Step 1: Analyze the information given\nIn our prior guess, the word \"Tiger\" had only 1 letter that is also in the secret word. This means that four letters are not in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Find the intersection of letters\nTo increase our chances of finding the secret word, we need to find a word that shares the common letter from our prior guess.\n\nStep 3: Deliberate possible options\nTo find a word with an intersection, we may consider words that contain the letter \"T\" and have a different combination of four letters. It's important to choose a word that hasn't been guessed before.\n\nStep 4: Make a new guess\nAfter considering all the options, we can make a new guess. Let's go with the word \"Trick\" as our next guess.\n\nNew Guess: Trick",
      "Step 1: Analyze the previous guesses\nBased on the information provided, we can see that in both previous guesses (\"Tiger\" and \"Trick\"), only 1 letter is also present in the secret word. This means that the common letter between the two guesses is the same. Let's identify that common letter.\n\nCommon letter: \"I\"\n\nStep 2: Generate new word options\nSince one letter intersected between the previous guesses, we can try to come up with new words that include this common letter \"I\" and have different combinations of letters.\n\nHere are a few options:\n1. Pitch\n2. Digit\n3. Chili\n\nStep 3: Choose the next guess\nNow, we need to decide which of the generated word options to choose as the next guess. Since we have no further information about the secret word, any of the generated words could be a potential match. Let's select one of them.\n\nNext Guess: Digit",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses\nFrom the prior guesses, we know that each word guessed had 1 letter that is also in the secret word. This means that there is at least one common letter between each of the guessed words and the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Find the common letters\nTo find the common letters, we can take the intersection of the letters present in each of the prior guesses. Let's analyze the letters in each of the prior guesses:\n\n1. Tiger: Common letter(s) with Trick and Digit: i\n\n2. Trick: Common letter(s) with Tiger and Digit: i\n\n3. Digit: Common letter(s) with Tiger and Trick: i\n\nTherefore, the common letter in each of the prior guesses is 'i'.\n\nStep 3: Make a guess\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the common letter 'i' is present in the secret word. To make a new guess, we can construct a five-letter word that includes the letter 'i' and also uses other letters that have not been guessed yet.\n\nOne possible guess could be the word \"Brick\", as it includes the common letter 'i' and has three other unique letters (b, r, and c) that have not been used in the prior guesses.\n\nFinal guess: Brick",
      "Step 1: Analyze the previous guesses\nWe have made four previous guesses and received feedback on each of them. Here's a summary:\n- Tiger: 1 letter in Tiger is also in the secret word.\n- Trick: 1 letter in Trick is also in the secret word.\n- Digit: 1 letter in Digit is also in the secret word.\n- Brick: 0 letters in Brick are also in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identify the common letters\nBased on the given feedback, the letters that are in all three previous guesses (Tiger, Trick, Digit) are \"i\" and \"r\". The letter \"i\" is also in Brick but since we received a feedback of 0 for it, we can exclude it.\n\nStep 3: Generate possible words\nUsing the common letters \"i\" and \"r,\" we can come up with possible five letter words to guess. Here are a few options:\n- Fiver\n- River\n- Timer\n- Rider\n\nStep 4: Choose the best guess\nOut of the possible words generated in step 3, we need to select the word that has the highest chance of containing a letter in the secret word. Since we received positive feedback for the letter \"i\" in all our previous guesses, it's reasonable to assume that the secret word contains the letter \"i.\"\n\nTherefore, the best guess would be \"River.\"\n\nFinal Answer: River",
      "Based on the information given so far, we know that the secret word has no letters in common with the words Tiger, Trick, Digit, Brick, and River. \n\nTo increase our chances of guessing the secret word correctly, we need to choose a word that has a different combination of letters than the previous guesses. \n\nLet's analyze the letters in each of the previous guesses and see if we can find any common letters:\n\n- Tiger: T, I, G, E, R\n- Trick: T, R, I, C, K\n- Digit: D, I, G, I, T\n- Brick: B, R, I, C, K\n- River: R, I, V, E, R\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that the letters \"T\", \"R\", and \"I\" have appeared in all of the previous guesses.

      "Step 1: Analyze Prior Guesses\nFrom the prior guesses, we know that the secret word has at least 2 letters that are also present in the word \"haiku\" and at least 1 letter that is also present in the word \"words.\" \n\nStep 2: Find Common Letters\nTo improve our chances of guessing the secret word, let's find the intersection of letters in both \"haiku\" and \"words.\" \n\n\"Haiku\" contains the letters: H, A, I, K, U.\n\"Words\" contains the letters: W, O, R, D, S.\n\nThe intersection of these letters is: H, A. \n\nStep 3: Generate Possible Words\nNow let's generate words using the letters \"H\" and \"A\" as a starting point. Some possible five-letter words could be:\n1. Ahead\n2. Human\n3. Happy\n\nStep 4: Choose the Word to Submit\nBased on the information we have and the possible words generated, let's choose one word to submit. From the three options, we can select \"Human\" as our guess.\n\nWord Submission: Human",

From the given words, we can identify the letters \"a\" and \"s\" as common in \"haiku\", \"words\", and \"Human\".\n\nStep 3: Generate Possible Words\nUsing the common letters \"a\" and \"s\", we can generate a list of possible words. Some examples could include \"asias\", \"sushi\", \"has\", \"pass\", and \"mass\".\n\nStep 4: Choose the Final Word\nConsidering that the secret word is five letters long, we need to select a word from the generated list that meets this criteria. \n\nOne possibility is the word \"mass\", as it fulfills the condition and includes the common letters \"a\" and \"s\". Therefore, \"mass\" will be the final word submitted to the other player.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance.",

Since \"assistance\" has 2 letters in common with the secret word, it is likely that one of these letters is \"a.\"\n\nFinally, let's find the intersection of the letters in \"haiku,\" \"well,\" and \"assistance.\" Here, we can see that \"a\" is a recurring letter.

However, we don't know the specific letters that are in the secret word.\n\nStep 2: Identify the common letters\nTo maximize our chances of guessing the secret word, we should look for letters that are common among the previous guesses. Let's analyze the letters present in each word:\n\n- haiku: Contains the letters \"h\", \"a\", \"i\", and \"u\".\n- words: Contains the letters \"w\", \"o\", \"r\", \"d\", and \"s\".\n- Human: Contains the letters \"H\", \"u\", \"m\", \"a\", and \"n\".\n- assistance: Contains the letters \"a\", \"s\", \"i\", \"t\", \"e\", \"n\", and \"c\".\n- well: Contains the letters \"w\", \"e\", \"l\", and \"l\".\n- abase: Contains the letters \"a\", \"b\", \"s\", and \"e\".\n\nStep 3: Determine the common letters among all previous guesses\nWe can see that the letters \"a\" and \"e\" are common among all the previous guesses. Therefore, these two letters are more likely to be a part of the secret word.\n\nStep 4: Make an educated guess\nBased on the analysis, a logical next guess could be a five-letter word that contains the letters \"a\" and \"e\" in any position. One possibility is the word \"alive\".\n\nSubmit the word \"alive\" as a guess.",
      "Step 1: Analyze the prior guesses.\nFrom the prior guesses, we can see that the secret word has at least one letter in common with each of the following words: haiku, words, Human, assistance, well, and abase.

From the prior guesses, the letters 'a', 'i', 'e', 's', 'u', 'b', and 'h' are common.\n\nStep 3: Construct possible five-letter words.\nUsing the common letters identified, we can construct several possible five-letter words. Here are a few examples:\n- abuse\n- based\n- issue\n- heads\n- sash\n\nStep 4: Choose the next guess.\nAmong the possible five-letter words, we need to select a word that differs from all the prior guesses.

This means that the word should have at least one letter that is common with each of the prior guesses, except for \"guess\" which had zero letters in common.\n\nStep 2: Identifying Common Letters\n\nBased on the information we have, let's identify the letters that are common between the prior guesses:\n\n- haiku: a, i\n- words: s\n- Human: a\n- assistance: a, s\n- well: l\n- abase: a\n- sash: s\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that the letters \"a,\" \"i,\" \"s,\" and \"l\" have appeared commonly in the prior guesses.\n\nStep 3: Formulating the Guess\n\nWe need to come up with a five letter word that uses the common letters mentioned earlier: \"a,\" \"i,\" \"s,\" and \"l.\" \n\nA potential word that satisfies this condition is \"sail.\"\n\nTherefore, the word we should submit to the other player is \"sail.\""

Therefore, we can eliminate the letter G from consideration.\n\nThe word table has 1 letter in common with the secret word, but since we eliminated the letters F, U, E, L from the word FUEL and the letters C, O, R, E, T from the word correctly, we can conclude that the letter T from the word table is not in the secret word. Therefore, we can eliminate the letter T from consideration.\n\nNow, let's consider the common letters between the word guess and the secret word. We know that 3 letters in guess are also in the secret word. Since none of the eliminated letters are present in the word guess, we can conclude that the 3 common letters from guess are still possibilities for the secret word.\n\nPutting everything together, we have:\n\n- Secret word contains 1 letter from luck\n- Secret word contains 1 letter from game (excluding G)\n- Secret word contains 1 letter from table (excluding T)\n- Secret word contains 3 letters from guess\n\nNow, let's find a word that satisfies these conditions. By looking at the possible common letters, a word that meets these criteria could be \"SNAKE.\" \"SNAKE\" shares 1 letter with luck (K), 1 letter with game (A), 1 letter with table (A), and 3 letters with guess (A, E, K).\n\nTherefore, the word we will submit to the other player is SNAKE.",
      "Based on the given information, let's analyze the prior guesses:\n\n1. luck - 1 letter in \"luck\" is also in the secret word.\n2. FUEL - 2 letters in \"FUEL\" are also in the secret word.\n3. correctly - 2 letters in \"correctly\" are also in the secret word.\n4. game - 1 letter in \"game\" is also in the secret word.\n5. table - 1 letter in \"table\" is also in the secret word.\n6. guess - 3 letters in \"guess\" are also in the secret word.\n7. SNAKE - 2 letters in \"SNAKE\" are also in the secret word.\n\nTo determine the next word to guess, we need to find the common letters in the previous guesses. \n\nLooking at the letters present in each guess, we can see that the letter combinations \"C\" and \"K\" have been consistently present:\n\n- In the 2nd guess, \"FUEL,\" the letters \"E\" and \"L\" are common with the 3rd guess, \"correctly.\"\n- In the 4th guess, \"game,\" the letter \"E\" is common with the 5th guess, \"table.\"\n- In the 6th guess, \"guess,\" the letters \"S,\" \"E,\" and \"S\" are common with the 7th guess, \"SNAKE.\"\n\nTherefore, the common letters from all the guesses are \"C,\" \"E,\" \"K,\" \"L,\" and \"S.\" We can use these letters to form our next guess.\n\nLet's try the word \"SLEEK\" as our next guess. This word incorporates the common letters \"E,\" \"K,\" and \"L\" while also containing the letter \"S\" from the 6th guess, \"guess.\"\n\nThus, the word we will submit to the other player is \"SLEEK.\"",
      "Based on the information provided, let's analyze the letters in each of our prior guesses:\n\n- luck: 1 letter in the secret word\n- FUEL: 2 letters in the secret word\n- correctly: 2 letters in the secret word\n- game: 1 letter in the secret word\n- table: 1 letter in the secret word\n- guess: 3 letters in the secret word\n- SNAKE: 2 letters in the secret word\n- SLEEK: 2 letters in the secret word\n\nTo increase our chances of guessing the secret word correctly, let's focus on the letters that have been consistent in the previous guesses. \n\nFrom the previous guesses, it seems that the letters E, L, and K are consistently present. So, we should include these letters in our next guess. \n\nTo come up with a new word, let's mix and match these letters: E, L, K. \n\nA possible word we can form is \"LEAK\". This word includes the letters that have been consistent in previous guesses. \n\nTherefore, our new word to submit to the other player is \"LEAK\".",
      "Based on the prior guesses and the number of letters in each guess that are also in the secret word, we can narrow down the possible letters that could be in the secret word.\n\nFrom the previous guesses, we know that the letters \"E\" and \"L\" are in the secret word. However, we are unsure about the other letters.\n\nTo make our next guess, we can look for words that contain the letters \"E\" and \"L\" and have not been guessed before. Let's generate some options:\n\n1. STEEL\n2. ELSE\n3. HEEL\n4. TEEN\n5. FEEL\n\nNow, let's consider the number of letters in each option that are also in the secret word. This will help us prioritize our guesses.\n\n1. STEEL - 2 letters in STEEL are also in the secret word.\n2. ELSE - 2 letters in ELSE are also in the secret word.\n3. HEEL - 1 letter in HEEL is also in the secret word.\n4. TEEN - 1 letter in TEEN is also in the secret word.\n5. FEEL - 2 letters in FEEL are also in the secret word.\n\nBased on this information, we can see that \"STEEL,\" \"ELSE,\" and \"FEEL\" are the strongest options. Since \"ELSE\" has already been guessed, we should prioritize \"STEEL\" and \"FEEL.\"\n\nConsidering that \"STEEL\" has already been guessed and had 2 letters in common with the secret word, it is more likely that \"FEEL\" is the correct word. Therefore, my next guess will be \"FEEL.\""
